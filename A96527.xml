            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>RIEND and Chriſtian Reader, It is the property of Divine truth after it is manifeſt in the ſpirit, to inflame a ſoule with it, and to ſwallow up the ſpirit in the glory of it; ſo as it is as impoſſible for a ſoul to enjoy Truth and not to declare it, as for a man to carry fire in his boſome or mouth, and not be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Saints are mightily conſtrained after they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy Truth, from the fire of Love, to declare it. Now I having had ſad experience of the waies of my own heart, how I have constantly Rested below God, and ſo have fallen ſhort of his glory. This being my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for a long time, though in every particular ſeeming to me to be God, and of God, and in it my condition happy; where I was continually running from mauntain to hill, becauſe I knew not the true Reſt. But at laſt it pleaſed the Father of ſpirits to reveal himſelf, and by the ſame to make them mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt. Whereupon I have had much wraſtlings in my own ſpirit, about putting the ſame out to publique view; but at laſt was forced to break through much oppoſition in my own heart, and to put it out in this imperfect Form: That if it be the wiſdome of God in the ſame, others by mee may learn to beware: yet I would not have been without the experience of the
<pb facs="tcp:153757:4"/> ſame, ſeeing it is the will of God now to diſſolve it. Wherefore Chriſtian Reader, I ſhall commend theſe enſuing particulars to thee, and thee to the wiſdome of the Spirit, whereby thou mayeſt judge of the ſame in love.</p>
            <p>Firſt, If thou canſt cloſe with the ſubſtance of my diſcourſe, and after finding ſome circumſtances which are either contrary to thee, or obſtructive to thy prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; yet do not fly out into bitterneſſe of ſpirit, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt what thou judgeſt truth, neither againſt that which thou judgeſt no truth; but receive the one, and let the other alone, until <hi>God</hi> reveale the ſame unto thee; leſt thou bee found calling light darkneſſe and darknes light, and ſpeaking evil of things thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not; but in meekneſse judge, and Reſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If thou haſt not paſſed through theſe, or all theſe Reſts or Diſpenſations, or haſt not as yet at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to many things herein expreſsed; yet let them have thy charitable thoughts, and do not as the most do, fly out againſt them as Errors, becauſe they are not either within their reach as to high for them, or becauſe they are contrary to their preſent principles, and ſo would unbottom them; or becauſe they are not according to what they have been taught, or is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced in them: But judge of them in love; and where any thing is above thy experience, I wiſh thou mayeſt be ſilent in it, and waite to know it, if it bee of <hi>God:</hi> and if it be to low for thee, let it receive encouragement from thee, as thou haſt paſſed to thy eſtate through theſe <hi>Adminiſtrations.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:153757:4"/> Thirdly, Chriſtian Reader, paſſe by any infirmity thou ſeeſt, either in expreſſion, forme or method: look upon them to bee a diſcourſe of experience, more to edify, then to pleaſe the fancy, <hi>by curioſity of words in mans wiſdome,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 4.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Do not judge me to deny any thing which I do not here affirme, becauſe I am ſpeaking ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all things within: But look upon it as a ſpirituall, and inward diſcourſe; holding out the two great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, <hi>viz.</hi> The Myſtery of Chriſt made manifeſt in the Spirit within man: and the Myſtery of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to himſelfe. Do not think I am going about to deſtroy the low workings of God, I am not: Neither be much daunted if God hereby lets thee behold the face of ſelf and falſe Reſts, ſo as it brings thee to a loſſe: But believe it, thy greateſt loſſe may in time become thy greateſt gain: For that which moves mee to write theſe few lines is, that if it be the will of God, Creatures may ſee the many falſe waies and Reſts below God: That Creatures may not live ſhort of his glory as I have done.</p>
            <p>Therefore I ſhall deſire that I may not be miſtaken, either in my intentions or expreſſions, and therefore ſhall commend this farther to the Reader; Firſt, To take off a ſcruple which may lye upon many, whether I do deny theſe ſeventeene Reſts to be diſpenſations of God, and the way God leades men into their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Reſt, which is Chriſts Coming in the Spirit: That I may cleare this, and make farther way; I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, it is Gods way to lead Creatures through
<pb facs="tcp:153757:5"/> theſe particulars: But the corruption of ſelfe, and the deceiveableneſſe thereof, will-reſemble the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of God, and ſo will labour to live, and keep the ſoul to Reſt ſhort of God; and man in going after the waies of his own heart, may ſeem to be led by <hi>God:</hi> But in theſe particulars I labour to drive on two things, The firſt to diſcover unto men, what the way of mans heart is, when it will deceive, and what glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it will appear to the Creature in, untill God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive it: ſo that I am firſt to undeceive Creatures, in their unſound confidence, concluding their eſtates to be ſo high that they are at Reſt in God, when they are covered with a covering, but not of the Spirit. And though the heart bee putting God in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front of its actings, yet it is but <hi>Jehues</hi> deceite and treachery of ſpirit. Secondly, I labour to un-deceive it, that though it hath attained any, or all theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen, and have not had an appearance of Chriſt ſpiritually in them, ſo that they know when, and how, and what Chriſt infallibly was, that ſtill that ſoule is but yet in a changeable condition: And it may as well be Satans transformings in him, as any diſpenſation of God to him: and to let the Creature know, that though he have paſſed through all this, yet he wants one thing to be his Reſt and Center; which when it comes, will diſcover the truth of all theſe Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and if they be of God, they ſhall be diſſolved, if they be of ſelf or Satan, they ſhall be deſtroyed: So that to unbottom Creatures, That they live not upon vanity and lyes, and that they may not Reſt before
<pb facs="tcp:153757:5"/> the true appearance of Chriſt in the Spirit, I have ſet forth theſe imperfect lines. Farther, I would not have any think that I deny Scriptures, Ordinances, Chriſts coming in the fleſh, Kingdome after death, or any thing here I have inſerted to be falſe Reſts: But that I aime at, is to ſet all things in its proper place, and to bring ſoules to ſee the true Center; that they may not miſſe the one thing neceſſary, while they are acting beyond their line; in which actings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves may become <hi>caſt-awayes:</hi> and that men may know, That neither Scriptures, or Chriſt in the fleſh, Oridnances, or Members of Churches, or the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome after death, or the form of Words in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or Promiſes, is the Reſt of Saints; But He who is the ſumme and ſubſtance of all, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt in the Spirit Coming in us, to be Life, Glory, Light and Happineſſe to us; and ſo an <hi>hope of glory in us.</hi> This is the Reſt of Saints. But Chriſtian Reader, God now in theſe daies is diſcovering the falſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verings of creatures, and ſo ſtripping them naked; God is bringing men to ſee this great Myſtery of ſelf in all its glory: Hee is annihilating Creatures, and bringing them to a ſpirituall death: He is lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing low mountains, and un-bottoming and un-reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Creatures: Mens lofty looks He is abaſing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, He is bringing men who have been <hi>Stars,</hi> and ſomething in their own, and others eyes, even to a loſſe and ſilence, confuſion and darkneſſe; That now their <hi>light is darkneſſe,</hi> their <hi>wiſdome folly,</hi> their <hi>life death,</hi> their enlargements and
<pb facs="tcp:153757:6"/> ſelf-actings <hi>hedged up,</hi> and they cannot finde out any of their former Paths; ſo that now they are made to waite in ſilence, as well as the Author of this Book was forced to do; and it may be the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, that this particular ſhall be an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of good, as well in this, as it hath been before i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> came in this publique view, to many ſoules, in another manner and method; ſo that I ſhall leave them, to receive at thy hands what Cenſure the Wiſdome of God pleaſeth to cauſe or permit, wiſhing thy exceeding happineſſe in the Spirit.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE firſt Reſt which we ſhall ſpeak of is, Civility, or a common reſtraint of the Creature from the committing of groſſe evils: looked upon by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be Reformation. This conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or diſpenſation, ſpeaks deceivea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Peace to many a ſpirit; upon the which ſeeming good, which pretends to follow this ſtate, the creature reſteth and is ſatisfied. But the reaſon thereof partly flowes from theſe following grounds.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From comparing himſelf with others: that is looking upon the groſneſſe of mens actions abroad in the World: as namely, ſwearing and drunkenneſſe, and the height of all prophanes many ſpirits live in, where they are in the ſame condion, <hi>Drinking up iniquity</hi> as if they were drinking up water: and in theſe particulars hee being reſtrained, and more civillized then theſe, he bleſſeth himſelf in his preſent condition, and Reſts ſatisfied with it, as though in it he did enjoy much of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It flowes from comparing his condition preſent, with what it was: The more groſſer his condition was before, the higher it works him into conceit, with the happines of its preſent condition. Thus not ſeeing the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:153757:7"/> purity of God, and the deceitfulnes of its own ſpirit within; he comparing himſelf with himſelf is deceived, and ſo reſts ſatisfied.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It flowes from the conſideration of the greatnes of love (hee had before being reſtrained) to thoſe groſſe evils he is reſtrained from; together with the greatnes of the power, which he cals the divine power of God, which thus reſtraines him: and thus he reaſons, If God did not highly love me, I ſhould never have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſuch a power from him as to ſhake off, and not only ſo, but to ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e and obhorre thoſe groſſe ſinnes I ſo decrly loved, both in my ſelf and others; and now the very practiſe of them, being as he conceives, hated by him, ads weight to his thus reaſoning out the Love of God. Another thing which ads weight is, his often pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt ſuch particular ſins as yet remaines unſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued; and afterwards theſe being ſubdued (he looks upon acceptance with God in this being) he lookes upon it as an anſwer of prayer; and ſo in the ſame, he reaſons out love in this condition.</p>

It flowes from the ſeeming ſorrow, which ariſeth continually, upon the view of his former condition; which workes a ſeeming repentance and reformation; and from the ſorrow he hath for his former condition; now having a work of Reformation, he Reſts under the notion of happineſſe; yet not all this time brought home to ſee the groſneſſe of his heart within; but meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waſhing the outſide, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 39. and being a whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted wall, glorious without, it is all he looks for, or ſeeks after. But Satan and mans heart will ſuffer the creature to act ſo farre, and propound ſuch waies to himſelf, as in the ſame to bring the ſoul into a ſtate of ſecurity, where it may reſt under the conſideration of being happy; and not without ſome viſible ground, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent both to the creature thus deceived, and the World who are not ſpirituall diſcoverers: But alas

            <p>And ſeeing in this eſtate of darkneſſe none can truly judge of its condition aright, untill the true light come in, which makes all things manifeſt: Then it behooves ſouls in this eſtate, though to themſelves never ſo ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly glorious, not to Reſt ſatisfied with, or content it ſelf in it, as though it did enjoy God, in the ſame ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted; but to wait for a higher diſpenſation; and then the truth of this diſpenſation ſhall be diſcovered, whether it be of God or man; if of God, it ſhall be diſpelled by a higher; if of man or Satan, it ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed:

               <head>The Second falſe Reſt.</head>
               <p>THe ſecond Reſt moſt commonly of Soules, after a common reſtraining the Creature from groſſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, is a work ſeeming to the Creature ſomething high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: and that is in obedience unto what the Law of God requires.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, A negative Obedience from ſomething. The ſecond, is an affirmative Obedience to ſomething; and this ſeems to the Creature to go beyond the other, and ſo become a ſurer foundation of Reſt: when indeed it is all one with the other, and ſtill ſhort of the true Reſt: And here comes it to paſſe, that in this diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation man hath no longer peace, then he acts ſutable to the Law; break the Law, and it breaks the neck of the Souls peace: Keep it, and it keeps the Soul in peace.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, in this condition it comes to paſſe, that the Creature is wholly caſt down, and begins to queſtion all he hath, yea, the very foundation of all: when in the leaſt manner he doth tranſgreſſe. But ſtill the ſoul is in a very low and empty diſpenſation: but mans obedience to the Law (wherein he intends by his obedience to it, to get happineſſe and life from it) flowes from theſe particulars following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From a convincement of his miſery out of God, in which he ſees a want of God; upon which he runnes unto the Law, being convinced by it, to ſee what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of it. He now reſolves, makes Covenants, Vowes, renewes them often, and purpoſeth to doe what the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:153757:8"/> Law requires: To this end he fals aboard of praying, reading, keeping Sabbath, and ſpends nights and daies in labouring to attaine to what the Law requires. And</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Law requiring, as the principall part of it, Love. Now this is the daily complaint of ſuch a ſoule in this diſpenſation: Oh that I could love God, then I could believe God loved mee: then it being the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall part of the Law, I could believe it were fulfilled, either in mee or for mee; then ſhould I enjoy peace, and Reſt in my ſpirit; not knowing that our love to God flowes from the manifeſtations of Gods love in us; not conſidering that the Law is fulfilled by another; not knowing that peace and Reſt flowes from the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God; and not from ſutable Quallifications to the Law of God: but now, when the ſoule hath, as he conceives, got ſo much love to God, as partly the Law of God requires; it Reſts, concluding this, That love to God is an infallible Token of Love from God: Yet not knowing that the way to judge aright of my love to God, is from the enjoyments of Love from God: And here lies the great deceit of many ſpirits. Again, The Law requires Sabbath keeping, and many ſuch like comands are required: The ſoule cryes, Oh that I could keepe the Sabbath. Oh that my heart could keepe cloſe with God upon that day: and here the ſoule labours to bring his heart into that frame, not to think his own thoughts or ſpeake his owne words; whereupon he ſets a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the morning, and exerciſes himſelfe in all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties agreeable to the day: now if he keepe the day ſo exact, as he thinkes the Law requires, he Reſts with much peace: but if he be dead, and cold, and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in theſe Diſpenſations he employes himſelfe in, then he can have no peace all the weeke, but is mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and grieving he hath broke the Law: and here is partly the frame of ſuch a ſpirit.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:153757:9"/>And the ſecond cauſe of his thus actings is, from an apprehenſion of wrath, and a condemning conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and hell within, it would doe any thing to aſſwage the wrath and fire of hell in his owne conſcience: What would not a ſoule doe or attempt, to remove the ſame, being at preſent too heavy for the ſoule to beare: now it would doe any thing to ſtoppe the mouth of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning conſcience, though it will pretend what it doth is for no ſuch matter: but the flatterings of the heart, and the gloſſe it puts upon the actions of the Creature in this Diſpenſation.</p>
               <p>Now the ſoule not diſcerning ſatisfaction given to God by another: it labours therefore to ſatisfie God for the breach it hath made betwixt it and God: though I ſay the heart here will gloſſe its actions, and ſay to the contrary. But now it ſeeing a breach, this breach muſt be made up before there can be peace: Now the ſoule not ſeeing the breach made up by Chriſt, he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to make up the breach by his actuall obedience to the Law of God: And therefore is it that men teach this Principle: The way to attaine Grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with God is, by ſuch a humiliation or ſorrow as they call God: And here they prove Aegyptian Task<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters, to ſet the Creature upon doing, when he hath no ſtraw to worke withall, <hi>Exod:</hi> 5. 13, 14. And this is uſuall with Creatures in this Diſpenſation, when they ſee themſelves in bondage, to get freedome by doing.</p>
               <p>And ſo comes it to paſſe many breake priſon before they be ſet free by the Spirit: As for inſtance, when the ſoule can finde ſuch a Qualification in him, or ſuch a frame of Spirit in him, as the Law requires, having a long time laboured for it, he judgeth himſelfe to be ſet free by Chriſt, when it is but a conceited freedome, as an effect of his obedience: and not as an effect of the obedience of Chriſt revealed to him in the Spirit. And
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:153757:9"/> in this particular the Creature is like a horſe that is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into a bogmire: he labours to plunge himſelfe out leſt he periſh there, and indeed plunges himſelfe faſter in, and brings himſelfe into a nigher way of periſhing: Thus the Creature ſeeing himſelfe fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> into miſery and bondage, he labours and plunges to free himſelfe, untill he plunges himſelfe into higher bondage: and as the horſe will not give over, and lye ſtill untill he hath wearied himſelfe, no more will the ſoule ceaſe acting to free himſelfe, untill he be wearied and worne out of breath: And then he ſhall be forced to wait untill He who delivers Saints out of the pit where no water is, come and deliver this Spirit out of his ſlavery and bondage. And alſo in an eſtate of darkneſſe the like, the Creature labours for light, and being encompaſſed about with pits on every ſide, and being in darkneſſe, he will not ſtay untill the Light come, or the day dawn; but at laſt for want of a Guide, which is the Spirit, he fals into the pit, where he lies more ſadder then ever. John 16. 15.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the common, though ſad effects of thoſe who run before God leades them: and either the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Reſts after he hath attained qualifications ſutable to the Law, or elſe brought up into a higher obedience to the Law: or he remaines ſenſibly miſerable of the greater miſery in it then before: which though it be more ſadder to the apprehenſion, yet it is the way of God in the Creature, thus to fruſtrate the expectation of the Creature in its labouring to worke happineſſe for it ſelfe, untill happineſſe be revealed within it.</p>
               <p>The Third cauſe is, from the principle of Nature; and here the Covenant of workes is moſt ſutable to the principles of Nature: Nature would alwaies be doing, though in its doing, it inſtead of acting to God, is acting from God: For it is impoſſible that man can truly act <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o God, before there be an acting of God in him. So
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:153757:10"/> that man cannot aſcend up to God, before there be a deſcending of God into the ſoule; which Deſcendings I call a reall manifeſtation of life within man, which is God; being a Fountaine breakes forth againe from man unto God: And before that, though ſoules act never ſo gloriouſly, yet they are but <hi>Adams</hi> running away from God, and from the principles of Nature, clothing themſelves, Gen. 3. 8. Which in time, though man Reſt upon it, proves ſelfe Righteouſneſſe, or a Righteouſneſſe according to the Law, and not the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teo uſneſſe of God by faith; and ſo his Reſt and peace ſhall be taken from him, and deſtroyed in him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The cauſe from which his thus acting flowes, is from ſelf-love; and this will goe beyond any thing formerly mentioned. Self-love in the gaining of its owne ends, will thinke nothing too difficult to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, nothing too deare to part withall, unleſſe the things we are now ſpeaking of, which is mans ſelfe. When a man is ſwallowed up with ſelfe, inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſwallowed up with God: whatſoever the Creature is put upon, when ſwallowed up with God: this Creature thus led forth out of ſelf-love, will reſemble the ſame, if not goe beyond it: nothing that ſtands in the way of the Creature thus poſſeſſed, is too deare to it, or too hard to attempt it. Put <hi>Jehu</hi> upon pulling down Idols, it made him very zealous, it made the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees give almes, and ſpend themſelves, and ſuffer theirs to be ſpent, to attaine their ends: It will put a man upon faſting much, praying often; yea, if it be to hazard life or liberty, it is free, if it may but accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh its owne ends: which is moſt commonly from a convicted happineſſe or glory, either inward from God, or outward from man: Self ſees a promiſe of life and happineſſe handed out in the Law to thoſe that keepe it: as namely, Doe this and live: it never conſiders what it could doe, and now can doe: but now it la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to try what may be done that an undone ſoule
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:153757:10"/> may be made happy: Oh the conſideration of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe doth ſo affect a ſoule convinced of the want of it; that as the love of God enjoyed, doth draw out that ſoule that enjoyes it too much for God: ſo this ſoule poſſeſſed with the love of ſelfe, doth draw out the Creature; not out of himſelfe, yet to doe or act any thing, that may procure happineſſe to it ſelfe: Alſo ſelf-love in this particular, would not freely have all from God, nor would it be beholding to God for all: then it ſhould have nothing to glory in but God: Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thoſe cryings out. Muſt the Creature do nothing; muſt he not take paines with his owne heart to prepare it for God? Muſt not the Creature ſeeke, and knocke, and pray, and be prepared for Chriſt? Not conſidering it muſt be a meere paſſive; Goe through the ſufferings of Chriſt, or rather to have fellowſhip with him in his ſufferings: that is, to be ſubject to the will of God, and to ſuffer God to diſpoſe, order, or burne up in the Creatures ſpirits as he pleaſeth; onely the ſoule to be a patient in the workings out of life, untill he can act from the enjoyments of it: The Lords way is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy, or burne up all the Creatures preparations for God, and all that ſtuffe the Creature hath within him, or attained by him; and ſtrips the Creature naked of all, either in him or done by him: and brings him as an empty ſoule to him who is the fountaine of life; and to be revealed in him. Now to take away an objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is, that the Creature muſt labour, though not for life, yet for a manifeſtation of life. To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; That the life whereby man acts to God, is by the power of life revealed from God; for before it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revealed, man is dead; it is the revealing of life into man, which gives life to man: So that man can neither truly act for life, or the manifeſtation of it, before man be made alive by it, which is not before the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, which is life to the ſoule. Secondly, That
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:153757:11"/> as mercy and love was prepared freely of God in Chriſt without the Creature; ſo it is to be revealed freely by Chriſt in the Creature: and after it be revealed in man: It is that grace which is in man, acts out from man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. That occaſioned theſe words from <hi>Paul, Yet not I, but the grace of God which was with mee,</hi> 1. Cor. 15. 10. Then let theſe following particulars be conſidered of.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That man who doth obey God, though his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience be never ſo ſeemingly glorious; yet if he Reſt upon, and be ſatisfied with it, he Reſts below the true Reſt, which is God. For though the Creature yeilds obedience to the Law, or any other Truth, as the Truth requires: yet he is not to Reſt upon it, though it be of, and from the Lord; it being flowne from that which is to be the ſoules Reſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That ſoule who being convinced of the want of, and its miſery without God; and from this labours to get God, by acting to God, though his action be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo glorious, it being to get his perſon acceptable, from the glory of his action, and Reſts here conceiving the acceptation of his perſon from the glory of his action, that mans Reſt and Conception is falſe.</p>
               <p>This was the reaſon why <hi>Abels</hi> Sacrifice was accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and <hi>Cains</hi> was not, becauſe <hi>Abels</hi> perſon was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, and <hi>Cains</hi> was not; for <hi>Cains</hi> action was as ſeemingly glorious as <hi>Abels</hi> was. But the acceptation of an action muſt flow fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the acceptation of a perſon. It is not, nor cannot be, that any mans perſon can be accepted with God, from the glory of any of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures actings to God. Then it ſhould be of workes, and man hath ſomething to boaſt of. Neither is my obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God a true evidence of my enjoyment of God, and acceptance with God. For the young man in the Goſpell, who was nigh to the Kingdome of God, did yeeld obedience to the commands of God; and yet he
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:153757:11"/> wanted that one thing neceſſary, which was to be the Reſt of his ſoule.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the Reſting upon any obedience to God performed in the exacteſt manner by the Creature, will bring nothing but death and ſorrow to the creature in due time: When man kindles a fire, and Warmes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the ſparkes thereof: God upbraids the creature thus by telling him, his end ſhould be to <hi>lye downe in ſorrow.</hi> That is, When God comes to appeare upon any ſoule in love, he burnes up all theſe falſe Reſts the creature hath beene making for it ſelfe. That is, What the creature drawes comfort from to himſelfe, if it be from the glory of any action: that is, for a man to kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e a fire, and warme himſelfe in the ſparkes or fire he himſelfe hath kindled. Iſai. 50. 10. 11.</p>
               <p>Now God at laſt brings the creature to ſee the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all his owne actions; and upon this there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but death to what he hath beene living upon, and ſorrow annexed for his thus living upon it, and Reſting in it.</p>
               <p>Therefore confider; No acting forth of the creature to God, before the creature receive a divine power from God, is acceptable with God; for God accepts of no obedience, but either that which he did by Chriſt for us, or by Chriſt in us.</p>
               <p>Now a man may doe great things by a power of Nature, which I call a power of God in its diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Which power, or from vvhich power, a man acts in a way to God: that is, ſeemingly to God and for God; but in concluſion proves not ſo; now God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of no action by us, unleſſe it be from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of himſelfe in us.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing our actings to God are changable, and may ſeeme to periſh though never ſo rare: It is no ſure Reſt for any ſoule: onely he who is unchangable in us, muſt be revealed to us, before any true Reſt can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by us.</p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:153757:12"/>
               <p>Now the condition of a Soul in theſe low diſpenſations is like unto a man affrighted by an enemy, and being ſo he labours to preſerve himſelfe from death by him; he runs to ſecure himſelf; at laſt he findes to his appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion a place of Reſt and ſafety, he being almoſt weary; afterwards it appears not ſo to be, but his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary purſues him, ſo that he is not ſafe; and ſo from place to place he runs to get ſhelter, he finding none, he is forced to yield himſelf up to the mercy of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, So it is with a Soule ſeeing God to be his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, he flyes as <hi>Adam</hi> did, thinking to ſecure himſelfe, and cover himſelfe; but God purſues the Soul and findes him out, where the Soule not finding any ſafe Reſt, yields himſelf freely with trembling and feare up unto God, to be at the mercy of God.</p>

               <head>The third falſe Reſt.</head>
               <p>THe next Reſt of a Soul below the true Reſt is, The excellency of Gift, which doe ſo mightily adorn the Creature, as thereby the Creature is led into high conceits of the glory and excellency of its condition. The firſt Part or Gift we ſhall ſpeak of is Knowledge.</p>
               <p>Multiplicity of knowledge, is ſuch a rare Part, as makes a man ſeem much like a Saint: not carnall in the matters of the world, but ſpirituall, conceived in the matters of God: and this doth mightily puffe up the Creature. And indeed much knowledge attained in the notion, unleſſe it be experimentall, there is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility to keep the ſoul from Reſting in it, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing puft up with it, And</p>
               <p>Firſt of all I ſhall diſcover, how moſt commonly the Soul attains this. The firſt is, from a quick appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion in the underſtanding of things, which is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon gift in nature; which is a ready way to attaine much knowledge, together with an enlaged capacity, that he can receive and keep what he apprehends, ſo as he comes to gather in knowledge apace into the notion; ſo as the Soule glorieth the moſt in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of that gift or part in which he doth the moſt excel. This Creature he is very fluent in diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the beſt things, and will be alwaies delighting the moſt, in arguing of thoſe things he hath the moſt knowledge in: and he being very gallant in diſcourſe, gathers knowledge in every thing he undertakes; and here he glories to overcome any with argument. Or,</p>
               <p>Secondly, To be adored, or had in high eſtimation for this his knowledge. And this applanding of him, makes his eſtimation of the glory of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>his own condition to be heightened; &amp; here he looks upon himſelf to be a Saint in glory; he having theſe parts of knowledge, makes him as often argue againſt truth as for it, that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:153757:13"/> others may ſee the wit and knowledge he hath; and by ſtrength of wit be able to ſpeak of higher things, then thoſe who ſweetly enjoy God: Yea, for parts of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge goes beyond, and by all is preferred before them. Now having thus attained knowledge in the head, though he doe not experience the ſame, he Reſts ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in his condition.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Knowledge which man Reſts upon, is a knowledge got by paines and diligence of things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him. That which is got by much pains, the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is more apt to Reſt upon: ſo as for the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary knowledge of the Scripture he exceeds. He is mightily fluent in the letter, and is able to ſpeak much from the ſame; and this doth furniſh him ſo, as now he makes it his glory to ſpeake of, and know much of the letter, though it is without him, and not experienced in him. But alas, what is it for any man to know much in this nature, and there Reſt. This is but the ſhell of Truth; the Subſtance is, Truth in us, experienced by us.</p>
               <p>To reade Truth in the letter without me and to know it there, is a diſpenſation; but to know it by the Spirit within me, muſt be a higher diſpenſation, and the Diſpenſation of Reſt. For what is it for any man to get all the Scriptures into memory to furniſh him with knowledge, able to diſpute or preach; yet unleſſe he know the ſame within himſelf, it's but a poor Reſt: yet thus it is, men by abundance of paines and diligence in the Scriptures and in books, doe get abundance of knowledge, and after it is gotten, they Reſt upon the ſame; as though it were to enjoy the manifeſtation of God, to enjoy much knowledge: here they abuſe a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of God, and transform it into another uſe then ever God ordained it for: So that though a man have never ſo much knowledge, yet though his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge be according to, or attained in the Scriptures, if
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:153757:13"/> he Reſt there, before he hath got it in the heart by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; as he hath got it in the head for diſcourſe, his Reſt is much below the ſubſtance of Truth. For no man is to Reſt in any thing without him ſo known, untill it be within him; and then he Reſts not in God becauſe declared in Scripture; but upon God becauſe revealed and experienced in him, and ſo is fully known by him.</p>
               <p>The third way whereby this Knowledge comes to be attained is, from the declarings of the experiences of others; he by the ſame ſtores himſelf with points of experience, as well as points of Judgement: and here he can ſpeak all manner of Languages, as well as thoſe that enjoy truth in them; ſo that he can ſpeak of points of judgement with thoſe that are for that diſcourſe; and points of experience, with thoſe that are for that; having a form of both in his underſtanding, and from that is able to make out himſelf, as thoſe who ſweetly in the power of Truth enjoy God: But for this latter, he hath but ſtolne the word from his Neighbour; hee hath got his experience to diſcourſe of. And this is the great deceit of mens ſpirits in our daies: for when they hear of a precious high Truth of God which they never heard of before, they eyther oppoſe it, or elſe they get the form of it into their notion or underſtanding, and the next upportunity they have, they declare it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> their own: whereas though they were convinced of the truth of it, yet they were to waite for the enjoyment of the power of it in themſelves; and that it might be ſealed by the Spirit in them (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 19, 20.) But ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny conceive, if they can but remember a truth, though they have it not in the power of it in themſelves, that the very believing of it and aſſenting to it, is the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of it: And theſe are thoſe who have a form of God, or the truth in their underſtandings, and wan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the power of that truth in their Spirits. Amd ſo many
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:153757:14"/> a ſoul Reſts in this very part of knowledge. Now the Reaſons of a ſoules reſting here, are partly theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Firſt, From a Compariſon made in his own ſpirit with others that are in lower diſpenſations, or weaker in knowledge or diſcourſe then himſelf: but eſpecially Profeſſors, who live in high thoughts of their eſtates: and he thus comparing his condition with theirs, and ſeeing it ſo far excell theirs; makes his concluſion, If their condition be happy, then mine is much more, in reſpect of what I have enjoyed more then they: I am not any way inferiour to any almoſt: ſurely I am in a happy eſtate if any.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Reaſon followes, from the high eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion others have of him; eſpecially men of the rareſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities and ſolideſt judgements, and this addes fuel to his fire of conceipt, and makes his Reſt the more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. And this is the reaſon that if at any time the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of thoſe—ceaſe to be what it was—that it occaſions much diſtraction and want of peace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelfe: for when part of a mans cauſe of Reſt and peace is taken away, no marvell then if part of his Reſt and peace go along with it. Whereas he that Reſts in God, is freed in the Spirit, and is as <hi>Mount Zion which can not be moved:</hi> Pſalm 125. 2. Let mans apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ceaſe, or encreaſe, he is not lifted up by the one, or caſt down by the other; but he hath a continuall te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony within himſelf, which abides for ever.</p>
               <p>The third Cauſe or Reaſon of his Reſting vpon the gifts of knowledge, is from want of a right information of judgement, in the difference betwixt a form of truth in the underſtanding, and the power of truth in the heart, not oppoſite to the other: for though mans knowing God in generall or from hereſay, be a diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of God, and good in its place, yet it is not to be Reſted upon, as though the ſoule had in this a reall
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:153757:14"/> enjoyment of God. Now a man may know a thing in generall, and may believe in it, aſſent to it and obey it, and make a large profeſſion of it: yet if he enjoy not God in that very thing, it is but a diſpenſation below the power of Truth. So that we ſee here, that men may get things into the head, before they be in the life and power of them in the heart, which if Reſted upon, brings with it a dangerous conſequence. As</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is the way to a high ſecurity, and ſuch a ſecurity, being but carnall, as is not without ground. It is the way in the ſecond place, to a ſelf-glorying and creature exalting, and to the diſplacing of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is the way to fall into all manner of looſneſſe, under pretence of freedome and knowledge of truth; and that it is no ſinne, though it doe this or that: For no marvel when a man hath no more then a form of God in the head, and wants the power of God in the heart; then that ſoul fals into a carnall looſneſſe, whereby truth is evil ſpoken of; and the party thus do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtifying his action by his hardneſſe of ſpirit, which by it he is brought into. And this is the reaſon why many when they have received high notions &amp; do hold them forth, do walk very unlike Truth, is becauſe they have it but in the head, and want the power of it in the heart. They have it from others, or ſome other way, and not from God; and ſo they cannot ſtand in the day of temptation, and ſo return <hi>like a Sowe to the wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the mire.</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 22.</p>
               <p>Again a Soul is further eſtabliſhed in this condition, from the dayly growth and encreaſe in knowledge; he daily growing in knowledge, is daily more eſtabliſhed on his own bottomes, though not ſo thought by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. This daily encreaſe of knowledge in himſelf, the benefit that ſometimes is redounded to others, by that doth encreaſe the flame, and addes fuel to the fire of this falſe Reſt.</p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:153757:15"/>
               <p>The ſecond excellent Part or Gift upon which men Reſt is, Prayer: and this is made an Idol of by ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties who Reſt upon it. But firſt of all when a man ſets his face towards God, it would gladly pray, but want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this proper Gift, it uſeth formes; but after it ſees the vanity of that diſpenſation and the emptines of it, it now would gladly pray in the Spirit; and continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is complaining for want of matter to expreſſe; In concluſion it attaines matter to expreſſe, and in the attaining matter doth much abuſe the ſame: but the means moſt commonly wherein it doth attaine it is, firſt, by often frequenting private and publike meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings where it ſteales away the expreſſions of others; and when it ſees one man enlarged, it is made to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire that part in them and cry out, O if I could pray as ſuch a one can, then I ſhould be at Reſt, and enjoy much peace. It preſſes forwards and by paines and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, it attains that enlargement, as that now it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels others, and is now admired by them, who before was admired by it; ſo as now the poor Creature can ſpeake three or four hours in prayers; and can hardly comprehend himſelfe within the ſpace of one houre; and here lies the deceipt of the heart, that here the Soule makes his Reſt; and this to be a ſure evidence of his intereſt in God. But alas, how blinde and unſound this preſent evidence is, let Scripture and experience teſtify: for alas, a hypocrite, or one who at all knowes not God, may excell in the ſeeming glory of this Part; yea, excell thoſe that live in the higheſt enjoyments of God: and here many ſoules make this diſpenſation a meer Idol, they draw all their peace and comfort from it: for if in this part the Creature excell, he will be the oftner uſing of it, living moſt upon it: draw moſt comfort from it, and glory the moſt in it: for if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Creature be ſtraitned in this particular, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to droop and be ſad, and full of trouble: but if
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:153757:15"/> either in publique or private he be enlarged much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, he is mightily refreſhed and lifted up.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, If at any time he cannot have thoſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon opportunities or ſet times, then al his peace is gone; and it is becauſe his peace is grounded upon his often praying, and his great enlargement in ſo doing, and indeed the ſoules blindneſſe lies here: for the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture takes his enlargement to be a manifeſtation, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of the preſence of God. Now a man may pray long and often, and excell all in externall form, and yet have none of the preſence of God manifeſted at all in the ſame: neither is a ſtraightning of the Creature in expreſſion, to be any cauſe of ſorrow or trouble, if God be manifeſt: neither is it an evidence of his not being manifeſted within. So here partly lyes the ground of a ſouls thus Reſting, or taking ſatisfaction or peace to his ſpirit, in this diſpenſation.</p>
               <p>Now I would not be miſtaken, that I am ſpeaking againſt this form or diſpenſation; when a man is not commanded by the form, but he is commanded from a power within, ſo as he commands it, and uſeth the ſame according to the end for which it was appointed. For I looke upon the ſame as to be a diſpenſation of God: But I looke upon the Reſting in it, or having peace by it, to be a corruption of a mans owne heart, and a deceit thereof.</p>
               <p>Firſt. Therefore I commend theſe things following to be conſidered of all.</p>
               <p>That though a man ſhould be never ſo glorious, or admirable in this particular diſpenſation, ſo as in the ſame he may be able to ſpeake a whole day together, yet his heart in this may deceive him, and if it doe not, yet it is no ſafe Reſt, or cauſe of peace, or ſatisfaction; or there is no ſafety in the excellents part, that can be received, but they take their wings and flee away; and here is not that in them, which men conceive.</p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:153757:16"/>
               <p>Secondly, Man may have theſe parts in the glory of them, and yet have no fellowſhip or commmnion with God in them: aud ſo they may be rather ſnares them ſure Reſts: Nay, if it were ſo, as many ſouls doth enjoy God in them, or rather communion with God in the ſame, yet it is neither the duty, or enlargement which is or ought to be the Reſt: but God made manifeſt in the ſame.</p>
               <p>The third Part or Gift is, Humility. And this ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times comes ſome of theſe waies following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Either from an inſtinct or property in nature. O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, It reaſons thus, <hi>God reſiſteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 5. Now in his high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of carriage, or turbulency of ſpirit, he looks upon his condition as to be reſiſted of God; whereupon he prayes and uſeth what meanes he can to reſtraine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; ſaith he, It may be I may be I may come to get a better temper of ſpirit, whereby I may not become both odious to God and man: Now I ſay at laſt, he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines a form or ſhape of what he doth deſire: and Reſts ſatisfied in the receiving of it: Though I ſay, he is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly but transformed into another likeneſſe: the cauſe yet remaining, which of the two conſider the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects that follow, as namely, Security, or lukewarmnes; or fulneſſe and ſelf conceitedneſſe; and ſo falſe Reſtings are of as dangerous a conſequence as the other.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Humility is by reſembling of ſuch proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of words and actions in an other, as is moſt lovely in the eyes of himſelfe and others: and here lies a ſad d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:153757:17"/> when men doe only reſemble the words or carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages of another, which it may be in that party flowes from a principle or power of God in him; and by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling of him, and getting into his form, think their condition is the happier, and ſo glory in it more then before: ſo that though his Humility flow from a divine work in him; yet the others is but ſhaped out of what is expreſſed, by or from him: and here lies much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, eſpecially if man Reſt in the ſame.</p>
               <p>The fourth way whereby humility comes moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to be attained. And the way indeed, is from the enjoyment of God, thereby man comes not only to have the effects or branches cut off, but the cauſe or root of the ſame taken away. So as now man hath it not in the form or ſhape, but in power and ſubſtance and now man is truly what he ſeems to be; but not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: whereby as the Creature is humbled, ſo God is exalted: and this is the Creatures joy, though not hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This is the reaſon why two Miniſters ſo profeſſing of themſelves, ſtudying their matter, the one brings it in a peece of paper, and the other in the ſame method or forme, though in his underſtanding; becauſe the one excels the other in this Part of Memory; and this makes the one more eſteemed then the other, and the one to appear more weake then the other. But alas, though all theſe were in one man, in a higher ſtrain then I have declared; yet they all were but a poor Reſt, or cauſe of joy or contentment to any heart: and truly when God appears ſo as to manifeſt himſelf, the Soul ſhall ſee the weakneſſe and folly of his ſpirit, to be ſatisfied in the whole, not to be any cauſe of Reſt, though they were diſpenſations of God, and were freely given by God: For all theſe may be in a very hipocrite, or in a meer naturall man.</p>

               <head>The fourth falſe Reſt.</head>
               <p>THe next Reſt in order to this, is Zeal for the truth. Zeal in the matters of God is that which the moſt gothrough, before the manifeſtations of God; yet though it be good in its place, and a diſpenſation to be owned, yet it is but a deceitfull Reſt. We know the cry of him in the Scripture, who was Reſting and glorying in his Zeal for God; when he cryed, come ſee my Zeal for the Lord of hoſts. So we know many mens zeal goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their knowledge of God in the ſpirit. We hear of a zealous <hi>Saul</hi> who was mad of zeal in perſecuting the Church Act. 22. 3. and out of conceit he did God good ſervice, Reſted ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>We know the Scribes and Phariſees who were the moſt Zealous for Sabbaths, and prayer, and other points of Worſhip; yet they make it their Reſt: but come to our daies, and ſee if we ſwarme not of the ſame, only ſeeming profeſſors of God, who are very Zealous for the ſame things; and from their very Zeal, are made to Reſt with high thoughts of their condition. But how far this zeal (which is moſt commonly led with more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection then Judgement) will bring man into a form of Truth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It will leade man into a whole conformity to what it doth conceive to be truth; that it ſhall, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what it hath, ſerve God in all good conſcience; Acts 23. 1. and according to the Law, to be unblamable and untaxable: Then his converſation ſhall bee very ſtrict, in the obſervation of what the Law requires, and hee ſhall act the ſame with much vehemency of ſpirit, taking all opportunities for the doing of the ſame.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It will carry the ſoule on to ſuffer cheerfully what he may meet withall in this very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:153757:19"/>
               <p>Thirdly, he may by Zeal afflict his body ſore, 1 <hi>Co.</hi> 13. 3. with faſting, and mourning, under pretence, the one to honour and obey God; the other for diſhonour brought to God: So as he may be almoſt ſpent in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and ſpirit, and eſtate, in proſecuting the things of God according to his light. Farther, hee may out of Zeal come to Goſpel precepts, and may be Zealous for that light in externall formes which is there required to be obeyed; ſo as he may gather Churches, and may ſuffer much, in the conforming to, and practiſing with ſo much vehemency, the Ordinances co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly practiſed by the Churches in the Apoſtles and our daies: ſo as his Zeal may lead him out to teaching and helping for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that worke, ſtudying night and day to finde out matter to furniſh himſelfe for edification: ſo as for paines in the Churches, and for Zeal to obſerve the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of thoſe formes, and any thing required to bee practiſed in the ſaid Churches; ſo as now it will have commun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on in Ordinances, with none but thoſe of his own ſtamp &amp; judgement; being mightily carried forth to judge and pity thoſe, who are oppoſers of that light: Now this ſoul through Zeal may goe thus farre, yea, to act up to the higheſt things the Scriptures doe require in matters of viſible practiſe, and yet be not at all taught in the Spirit, neither got into the life and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of what he doth profeſſe; but meerly zealous for ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes and wants the power; ſo as he is commanded by the form, and not the forme by the power dwelling within him. Now grant farther, That ſuch a ſoule did act in truth according to this diſpenſation, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in this particular, there were no cauſe of Reſt: for nothing viſibly ſeen, flowing from the Creature, ought to be its Reſt; but ſome inviſible flowings into the Creature, which is being and ſubſtance from which and unto which, a Soule through Zeale for God acts: Alſo a Creature thus zealous, Reſts not at home; but
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:153757:19"/> reformes abroad alſo, beginning with his own family, and ſo goes abroad to others, and labours for a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and practiſes the ſame with much Zeal; ſo as he can not endure the viſible appearance of any ſinne in himſelf or others. He may help with much Zeal the purging of Cities and Nations, of drunkenneſſe or ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, or any open prophaneſſe: he may be for puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of evil doers in this particular with much ſeverity, and ſeeming to be much troubled at the neglect of it; he may rejoyce much in this practiſe, and may help forward this work in a Nation very much, and yet this no Reſt at all: alſo he may be zealous, yea, mad of Zeale for the worſhip of his God in reference unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, not only taking all opportunities to inform them in the ſame; but uſing all Coercive powers for confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them thereunto; ſo as he may be an inſtrument to bring families and moſt part of Cities into this outward conformity to the matters of worſhip; and here hee lookes upon an action done of great moment and weight, and partly makes this an evidence of his true enjoyment of God, by Reaſon of his zeale for God, and the effect thereby produced, which is the good of many. Now the cauſe of a Souls thus Reſting, partly flowes from want of the information in judgement, of the great deceite of the heart, in putting man by zeal upon ſuch publique actions, and then to cauſe it to Reſt: and further, it conceiving it's Zeale for God, and from a principle of God; not being acquainted with a Phariſaicall Zeale, <hi>to be ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n of men,</hi> or to get a name amongſt men, or that Zeal which men have but not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to knowledge; or the Zeale <hi>Paul</hi> had before converſion, which excels both: for vehemency and downrightneſſe, is the Zeal of many a Profeſſor, who are at Reſt in our daies.</p>
               <p>Now a poor Creature becauſe he is made to ſuffer freely, and to hazard life and liberty in the proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:153757:20"/> of his Zeale, he is much puffed up under theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That now this is a ſuffering with and for Chriſt, and therefore he ſhall reign with him, and enjoy much from him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That this is a parting with all for Chriſt, and a great point of ſelf-deniall, and ſo an evidence of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Chriſt; when indeed the Soule is in himſelfe, and hath not at all attained that eſtate to forſake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Therefore let every heart, though never ſo Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for God, take notice, that his heart may deceive him in his Zeale and his affection may blinde his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo it proves blinde zeale. Or</p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſider, that though it be ſuch Zeale as is good and to be approved of in it's diſpenſation, yet not at all to be Reſted upon, nor to be an evidence of any true enjoyment of God, though he pretend God in the fore-front as <hi>Jehu</hi> did.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>The fifth falſe Reſt.</head>
               <p>THe next Reſt of a Soule, though I might not have ſpoken of it, becauſe I have partly given it forth; yet that things may be the more opened, its the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Righteouſneſſe or ſanctification, and outward ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, wherein both in carriage and words, he doth moſt ſweetly in probability, ſavour of high enjoyments of God. This is to be a teſtimony of the ſame to others, though not to himſelfe; yet notwithſtanding his Reſt is to him a high evidence of the true and reall poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of God, when alas, it is continually a vaniſhing Reſt and evidence; and when the Creature ſtands in need of it, it is taking its wings and flying away, and proves a miſerable comforter in the ſaddeſt ſtraits of a Soule.</p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:153757:20"/>
               <p>But firſt, Let us conſider, that true holineſſe of a perſon, made manifeſt in actions, flowes from the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of a Soule made manifeſt in the Spirit; ſo that the trueſt holineſſe, or outward ſanctification, doth wholly flow as an effect of Juſtification made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt: As for inſtance, The Fountain and the ſtreames: The ſtreames are an effect of the Fountain, flowing from the abundance contained in the ſame: ſo it is with God made manifeſt in the heart, he being the Ocean or Fountain comprehending all ſtreames within himſelf; doth iſſue out of himſelfe thoſe ſtreames of Sanctification or holineſſe in converſation from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thus abiding in the Creature. So that a man may have the latter in as high a manner, though not in truth, as he that hath God truly manifeſt; and no way to be diſcerned but by the light of truth dwelling within, which makes the truth or falſhood of ſuch things in this nature manifeſt; and before the ſame en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, the Creature is in darkneſſe, and it is as poſſible for a man to ſee twenty miles in a very darke night, as for a man really to judge of the truth or falſhood of his own condition before this light come in from God, which expels thoſe cloudes, as the ſhining of the Sun doth the cloudes; and here lies the darkneſſe of a heart when it is made to ſee the want of God, it looks into the frame and diſpoſition of mens ſpirits abroad, who are under a name of profeſſion, and being much affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them, and drawn out in love to them, it gets into ſuch relations or ſociety; and it ſees abundance of holineſſe flow from their converſations; now it being away to reprove that party, not having the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in holineſſe of walking, or power againſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, it cries out, O that I were ſo holy in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation as ſuch a one is: O that I had ſuch and ſuch a power againſt corruption as they have; and could be alwaies diſcovering of good things as they are; or could
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:153757:21"/> have my minde fixed upon heavenly things as they have. O how heavenly doth ſuch a one walke: and this is his conſtruction or application: O if I could be but ſo, I ſhould then be at peace and Reſt; then I ſhould think my condition happy; but alas here is ſuch abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of carnall mindedneſſe, and of corruption in my converſation; and a wearineſſe in things that are good: here the Creature takes up a daily complaint, and to every Saint is making his condition known, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Reſt quiet, untill he have reſembled or attained ſuch a meaſure of knowledgee to diſcourſe of God, and ſo much power againſt corruption, as to walke in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation like thoſe, whoſe converſation did convict him and aſhame him.</p>
               <p>Now having attained ſo much in ſhew, and that now his affections ſeem to be bent upon good things; that now God is his meditation and his continuall ponder: that now when its thus, the Creature hath much peace, ſometimes upon the view of the ſame: and when it cannot walk thus, it hath neither Peace nor Reſt. Now here the Creatures heart deceives him, and makes him Reſt upon that which may be in truth, and not in truth, or upon that which is given to change, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides not one and the ſame for ever. Now al this a man may have, and yet have nothing manifeſt in truth: and though it might be ſaid, that theſe are true in there place, yet not appointed for Reſts: but for effects of that which was in truth within: for he that ſaith, he dwels in him, <hi>ought even ſo to walk as he hath walked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now holineſſe in the higheſt degree, as it flowes out from man, is but an eſpeciall effect of the dwelling of the Spirit of God, or an effect of his Reſt in him; not to be a Reſt, but to manifeſt to others, that he dwels and Reſts in God: For to me, that Soule who Reſts and dwels in God, muſt have his converſation, but eſpecially, his inward walking like God: for to others
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:153757:21"/> that look upon a Saint thus pretending to dwell, muſt judge of the ſame by that fruit that flowes from him in one kinde or another: though it is not to be a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to himſelf, who thus liveth; he having another teſtimony which ſpeaks, or evidences Peace (1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 10.) upon more ſure grounds; yea, and lets the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſee a ground or place of Reſt, going as farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this, as the ſtreams are ſhort of the Fountaine, and the body of the Sun beyond the leaſt glimpſe or ſhining thereof. Man I may ſay, who is Reſting in peace and quietneſſe of ſpirit from theſe viſible branches, if they be true, is one who ſtill hangeth upon the outſide of the Arke: and like the Phariſees, Reſting with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious outſides, and waſhing of the outſide of Cup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; more to be ſeen of men, or juſtified before God, then to be as an effect of that truth within, made forth for the glory of God. The one of theſe ends did <hi>Cain</hi> act for, and the other end did the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> act for: ſo that a houſe builded upon ſuch a foundation as this, ſeems to be as glorious as that which was build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Rock, but it was not ſo ſafe; for with every blaſt &amp; ſtorm that comes againſt ſuch a ſpirit it fals into its former ſtate it was, in before thus builded: ſo were the devout <hi>Women,</hi> and golden <hi>Sepulchers, and whited walls,</hi> builded upon ſuch conſiderations as theſe they were outwardly holy, and ſeemingly pure; but were within full of deadly poyſon, and were put for outward glory, not adorned with the Spirit: ſo it is very likely that the ſaid Spirit, that Reſts upon this ſeeming, though thought by himſelf true holineſſe; is a Soul al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together full of deadly poyſon and deceite, which in time may be diſcovered, and then the Creature ſhall ſee another Reſt more ſure and ſafe then this, and ſhall loſe by it, yet Love ſhall ſave him, though it be a fire for to burn up what of this Reſt was of himſelfe: ſo that I ſay ſuch a ſoules foundation of Reſt, ſhall fade as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> in all his glory.</p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:153757:22"/>
               <p>Firſt, Then this Spirit thus Reſting, is away to keep it below true aſſurance; for in this Reſt, there can flow no true cauſe or ground to the Creature to be aſſured thereby.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For a man to Reſt here, it will be but to make a houſe, which ere long it may be God will bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter about his ears; and ſo prove labour in vaine, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny can ſpeak by ſad experience.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Whatſoever flowes from a man pretended to God, before there be an inward revelation in that man of God, and makes the ſame a true evidence of his enjoying this God thus revealed, and ſo Reſts: his thus doing is but his own righteouſneſſe, and not the righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt, revealed by faith.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That the party thus acting, doth go no farther then a point of bodily exerciſe; for what a man doth in point of holineſſe, pretending for God, and after doth owne it as a true evidence, or any cauſeof Reſt, as God. To me it appears, and in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Scriptures; that mans action is but bodily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe: for nothing is, or ought to be, either Reſt, or evidence of the true enjoyment of God in me; which is any way done by, or acted from mee; but ſomething in the which I am a paſſive, and no active; in which muſt be ſomething of God, coming in from God, which doth give a teſtimony of truth to me, and reveales the true Reſt in me: And if I Reſt otherwiſe, my Reſt is not that which I take it to be. So that it's alone the power or glory of ſomething coming to mee, and not the actings of that to God from me; which is all the hearts Reſt of a Saint.</p>
               <p>But there lyes ſo much deceit in the heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 9, 10. that the Truth muſt be known, by undeniable teſtimony in man, before the makings of it fotrh, can in truth be diſcerned: but as I ſaid before, man lyes in darkneſſe until there be ſomething in the ſoule which
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:153757:22"/> is a cleare light, giving the creature to know Truth from truths Teſtimony: for any action of deceit from the heart to God, as ſo pretended, will not be without reaſon and ground, yea, and Evidence proved to bee true by the heart: but ſtill this Light, which is God within, is that which diſcovers man to himſelf; yea, the winding of deceits in the heart, though never ſo cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly acted by the heart.</p>

               <p>Now true Soul-breakings, flowes from Love-melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; The Love, Majeſty and Glory of God, being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:153757:23"/> to man, do truly break man ſo, that he doth not Reſt upon his brokenneſſe, but upon him who by love brake it.</p>
               <p>The proud Phariſees did exceed in this, and many others who made it their Reſt, and bleſſed them ſelves in ſo doing; and ſaid, they faſted ſo often, and wept to much, and were ſo and ſo afflicted; when indeed they lived upon it, and gloryed and Reſted in the ſame.</p>
               <p>I know though it might be confeſſed, this is the way of God; yet it is not to be a Reſt to any man: For man is not able to judge of any Truth until the Light break in upon him; which makes all things manifeſt: and then ſhall man judge righteous judgement.</p>
               <p>The heart will perſwade man he acts from love, when he doth not ſo; and he humbles not himſelfe to be ſeen of men, or to get ſalvation; or the removall of a condemning conſcience; or to ſtop the mouth of conſcience; or to get a frame of ſpirit, that God might manifeſt mercy; when indeed the heart is altogether, it may be, deceiving of it: and yet not able to judge of the ſame, by reaſon of that night of darkneſſe that lyes upon it, wherein it is kept in the clouds.</p>
               <p>Now the cauſe of the creatures Reſt in this particular lyes here.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In thoſe many deliverances wrought out for him in this condition; as if the Children of Iſrael ſhould have been ſatisfied and Reſted, after God had brought them out of the Land of Egypt; or that after they were brought through the Red Sea, they ſhould have made that their Reſt; evidencing thereby that God would bring them into the Land of Canaan: when though God had delivered them, yet afterwards he did deſtroy them. So with many which God hath wrought ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with in this particular, in delivering them from ſtrong temptations, and making them to ſee much of power, yet afterwards they do not wait for the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:153757:24"/> of the promiſe; but murmur againſt God, and fall at laſt upon making a God to themſelves, of the glory of their wiſdome, and ſtrength, and naturall parts and light; and they fall down and worſhip the ſame, as though this was that God who did deliver them: and ſo Reſt ſatisfied, believing they are worſhipping and enjoying the true God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The creature reaſons thus, Surely it is God which doth diſcover ſin unto me; for if Satan ſhould diſcover it, it were the way to deſtroy his owne king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; therefore my ſight of ſin, and my ſorrow and mourning for it, and thoſe deepe afflictions which I have had for ſin, muſt needs be of God: and ſurely it is both love from God, and love to God, that doth thus break my heart. It may be ſo, and not ſo; but though it be God diſcovering, yet it is no ground for any ſoul to Reſt ſatisfied with, or to be an evidence of reall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying of God; becauſe that it is a diſpenſation which paſſeth away, when a higher diſpenſation of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, then would mans Reſt be diſolved, and not bee an everlaſting Reſt: But Saints Reſt is that which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be diſſolved, but it is an everlaſting Reſt to him that is Centred in it.</p>

               <p>THe next Reſt is that which many live upon; is the Notion of Free-grace, though they have no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of it in particuler to their own ſpirits; and here the very apprehenſions of it, being formerly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by it, now being convinced of the truth of the ſame, not from any enjoyment or powring forth of the Spirit; only he hath his underſtanding en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, and his judgement convinced; either by ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:153757:24"/> it to be a truth in Scripture, or from hearing it preached by others; or from the undeniableneſſe of the truth of it in it ſelfe; he is made to aſſent unto it as a truth; and never matters, nor underſtands it muſt bee particularly witneſſed to be his truth, from the ſame Revealed within him: But he not underſtanding this, he ſees now only, the emptineſſe of mans doing, and the vanity of putting the creature to act to get Love or Life from God: And ſo that only, now all the creatures acting to God, muſt be from Gods acting into the crea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture: ſo that now he is an enemy to that before he was<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a ſpeciall friend of, <hi>viz.</hi> his own righteouſneſſe: and that he is now gon as far in an extreame on the other, to Reſt ſatisfied onely with a Notionary knowledge of this ſayd truth: Alſo he ſees in this that nothing but a Chriſt can, or will doe good to ſpirits, and yet knows not this Chriſt within himſelf.</p>
               <p>Now ſome times man only getting a Notion of this Truth in the head, comes in the end to much looſneſs and fleſhly walking, 2. Gal. 17. and can put it off with a very fairer ſlight,</p>
               <p>Firſt, God is free in his diſpenſation, man can doe nothing unleſſe power be given unto him: I did ſuch and ſuch a particular, becauſe of the Woman; that is, by reaſon of ſuch weakneſſe I am yoked with all: or if God did intend I ſhould not have committed theſe ſins he would have given me power againſt them; and I ſhal admire free grace the more; and I ſhall love the more, the more is forgiven me. So though he hath no mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of God at all for the pardon of ſin, yet he lives continually in this ſtream, believing free grace is a Truth: this is to have it manifeſt; when the creature ſinnes, to beleeve it is freely pardoned upon the Croſs; when indeed now it ſleeps in ſecurity and looſneſſe: And the reaſon partly of its looſneſſe, and yet of its ſecurity is,</p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:153757:25"/>
               <p>Firſt, he hath got but the light of it; that is to ſay, ſuch a light as doth diſcover a truth in this to him; yet he wants the life and being of the thing made nanifeſt. So it comes to paſſe he profeſſes this particular, yet he doth not poſſeſſe the ſame in the nature of it: ſo he hath a name that he liveth, and yet is dead: ſo that he hath it in the head, but wants it in the heart; he hath got a form of it in his underſtanding, whereby he can diſcourſe of it and declare it to others, yet he wants the power of this ſaid truth in the heart within him: and when a man hath the forme, figure, or likeneſſe of a thing, and wants the power, glory, or being of the thing: no marvel then if a ſoul in a time of ſtraits, come to fall ſhort of what he doth proſeſſe in his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe; he not being able to ſtand, wanting the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he ſhould be formed upon, and the power of the ſame which ſhould keepe him upon that being or foundation.</p>
               <p>Alſo it may be he hath this truth taught him by man, and not from the teachings of God within: Now grace in the heart appearing, doth Teach man to deny ungodlineſſe and worldly luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly and Godly in this preſent world.</p>
               <p>But there is a cunning deceit in the heart, that in ſome doth (if poſſible can be) prevent the ſame; and it reaſons thus, I ſee this Truth is ſpoken againſt by moſt; and that thoſe that are for Free-grace are ſuch men as walk very looſly; and as ſoon as ever they believe this, that they are no more like the men they were before, but walke they care not how: but ſaith the ſoule that would make it a peaceable and honourable Reſt, leaſt they ſhould ſay ſo of me, I will walke alittle more wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then they doe: And here before men he walks very like Truth, though there be a heart within him not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in what he doth; and partly it is to get a good name amongſt men; for ſuch as walke looſly that profeſs
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:153757:25"/> God, they are hardly eſteemed of any: the world hates them for their judgement; the other cannot favour them for their looſe practiſe: Here they will labour to apply a remedy to this diſeaſe, in reference to one p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that is the Saints: They will amongſt Saints I ſay, carry themſelves like them, and reſemble them in their practiſe; as the Magicians did <hi>Moſes:</hi> Yet this is not from a divine principle of love, but for ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, or from another principle. Againe, Some walk like Truth, becauſe they make it a Teſtimony of Gods dwelling in them; for, ſaith the Scriptures, <hi>He that ſaith he abideth in him, ought himſelf alſo ſo to walk even as he walked:</hi> 1. John 2. 6. Now ſaith the creature, if I ſhould walk looſly it would appear to my ſelfe and all, That God dwelt not in me: but now by my out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward (and he thinks inward, though he be deceived) conformity to Truth, I may make it an evidence of my dwelling in Truth: and ſuch a man as this muſt needs curb himſelf of thoſe things that another ſwallows; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is his ground of peace and Reſt.</p>
               <p>Again, A man may ſhun looſneſſe, that hath but the notions of free grace; becauſe it is the way to make Diſciples, and get the affections of men to applaude and admire what flowes from him, ſo as he is mightilys eſteemed, yea, inſtrumental to diſpenſe thoſe truth that dwell not in him; ſo as it may bee hee is an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of begetting ſons like unto himſelfe; that is, to beleeve Free grace is a truth, and to be convinced of it, and deſpiſe working, which is oppoſite to it; and here they both ſit down and Reſt: Not knowing the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Gods dealings with the creature, which is moſt commonly to enlighten or convince man of a truth, and ſet the heart a waiting for it, before hee gives him an enjoyment of it. As for inſtance, He firſt convince<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> man of a Divine fulneſſe in God, and a ſupply given from God to bee diſpenſed by Chriſt to the ſonnes of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:153757:26"/> men; wherupon the creatures ſpirit is ſet a waiting for it, and at laſt comes to enjoy it: So in Free grace when God repreſents this truth, to let man ſee he is Free in all his diſpenſations; man being thereby convinced of it, his heart is ſet a waiting for the enjoyment of the ſame within him, which he ſees in God above him; that is above his reach of enjoying: and ſo he doth not let him Reſt though he ſee a truth, until he comes to have the manifeſtation of it within him, and in the power and life of it, enjoyed by him.</p>
               <p>So as the generall knowledge of Free grace, before it be known particularly in the creature, by the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of it from God, will be no ſecure Reſt or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for any ſoul.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The creature in this condition may receive it with much joy, as witneſſe them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 20. yet be ſhort of having the power.</p>
               <p>This truth is very pleaſant to many, eſpecially to thoſe that have been the greateſt workers for Grace; whereupn their delight is much taken up either in hearing, reading, or diſcourſe that tendeth to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring of this truth; and it is a diſpenſation of God in ſome men, but not a Reſt unto them.</p>
               <p>Now men who are made to Reſt here, may have high notions of this Truth; and may be more able to ſpeak of it, then thoſe who have enjoyed it in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>al manner: but come to the particular workings of it in the ſoul, and many proves ſhallow there; only they declare it as they ſee it, to be a Scripture truth; But he that Enjoyes, ſees it to be an Experimentall and a Scripture Truth. Now ſome men have learned what he beleeves, and Reſts upon it only from report; or men declaring their experiences, or what the Scripture doth relate of others; but have not any Teachings of God, what it ſaith (according to the Scriptures) in them by Experience: And here ſometimes, man is
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:153757:26"/> not compleatly furniſhed to declare this Truth: But one who doth enjoy Truth within, doth a little diſcern where ſuch a ſoul is; to wit, have heard, and from hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing do declare; and yet not brought into the Kingdome of Truth, to ſee and experience it with in himſelf. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Man may daily increaſe in the Notionary know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this Truth, wherein he may appeare a Tall Cedar in his owne eyes and in the eyes of others; and grow up into high Notions and Light, and is able to ſpeak of very high and glorious lights; yet if he here Reſt, it may prove in concluſion but a feeding upon winde and husks.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, In this knowledge of Truth may man ſolace and refreſh his ſpirits continually, in the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the ſame; and yet it is but ſeeming, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſatisfaction or refreſhment; if he there Reſt truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, to be God himſelfe, for want of information of the difference betwixt what is a Truth in it ſelfe, ſeen ſo by me, and a Truth mine, manifeſted within me; not knowing the foot-ſteps of truth without man, from the foot-ſteps of truth within man: not knowing a difference betwixt the deceipt of the heart in its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable workings, making glorious Reſts of that which is none; and Truth nakedly diſcovered from, or by God in the heart, with its End, and Teſtimony: ſo as the creature is not ſatisfied with any thing, though it be a truth, without him; until he finde the very being of that Truth within him.</p>
               <p>Therefore whoſoever he bee that reads theſe few lines, Let him beware of theſe things following.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that he judge not that to be a place of Reſt to his ſpirits, which is but in ſhew, not enjoyed in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; nor abſolutly paſſe ſentence of any thing, untill there be a Divine light within which makes it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt: Yea, though they may come ſo far as to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the truth of Free grace, and of the tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

               <p>Thirdly, To beware of condenming theſe things, becauſe they have no Experience of them; or becauſe they come nigh them; or becauſe if they be Truths, they have nothing left them; but waite untill they ſee a Light within, to diſcover the truth or fallacy of them, to them; <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 9. and if ſo be they ſee not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite of their hearts, or thoſe falſe Reſts in them, wee are ſpeaking of; yet do not condemn them, who have both ſeen and known them, as though they ſought to deſtroy the foundation of God in Saints<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but looke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me as one owning any diſpenſation of God, in its place proper to it.</p>

               <head>The Eight falſe Reſt.</head>
               <p>THE Next Reſt we deſire to ſpeak of, in order to this, is the Knowledge of Chriſt in the fleſh; Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſidered, as he is declared in Types and Figures under the Law, or as he aſſumed Nature upon him; and ſo conſequently dyed at Jeruſalem.</p>
               <p>Now for the firſt, In reference to Types and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, which at this time are the diſpenſation of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, either practiſed before, or ſince his Coming: How many in our dayes are they that meerly Reſts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch ſhadows; ſome practiſing of ſuch Types as held<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:153757:27"/> Chriſt to come; ſome in thoſe that were pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed after his Coming; and here they ſatisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. As inſtance the cry of moſt, Wee enjoy the pure Ordinances of Chriſt; wee are Members of the Church of Chriſt; we are partakers of thoſe outward priviledges purchaſed by Chriſt: Inſtance the peace and comfort they enjoy in them, the glorying and the high conceite they have of themſelves above others that do not practiſe with, or enjoy them; witneſſe their deadneſſe, flatneſſe when they want them, and their life and peace in the enjoying of them: witneſſe their binding up in them; and their whole Experience contained in this particular: When I was imployed in ſuch an Ordinance, I was fil'd with joy; or I was made to be ſatisfied with the ſeeing of God in it; when the poor Creature it may be, knowes not what God in all, or any thing is; but if it be enlarged, or have ſome particular <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ſhes of comfort, it makes that to bee the preſence of God; and meerly under theſe fleſhly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes or carnall relations do many Reſt ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>But Secondly, To Reſt upon Chriſt come in the fleſh, is to Reſt upon the beleeving the report the Scripture gives concerning him; as being <hi>borne of a <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgin, and ſuffering, and being buried,</hi> and the like: and if they beleeve this, and can but heare enough of the Letter preached to this purpoſe, they Reſt; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving ſuch a particular to be true: and that is all that is required of them to ſalvation: and indeed ſo it is, and ſomething more.</p>
               <p>But Thirdly, To Reſt upon Chriſt come in the fleſh, is to beleeve from the Letter of the Scripture, without any powerful manifeſtation of the <hi>ſpirit:</hi> that this, <hi>Chriſt</hi> who did according to Scripture dye at Jeruſalem, dyed for them: And here many ſatisfie themſelves, with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high conceits of their condition; and here alone men Reſt upon the bare Figure: As if men under the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:153757:28"/> Law ſhould have made Circumciſion, and the enjoying of Sacrifices (in that common manner they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed) to be a ground of Reſt; and ſo contented themſelves in the uſe thereof, as conceiving themſelves to be made happy, by the Type and Figure; and not by that which was Typified out in the ſame. So concerning Chriſts dying at Jeruſalem, it was a Figure of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall death of the creature with Chriſt; and alſo of his reſurrection.</p>
               <p>Now when we come to be buried with him, <hi>into his death, Rom.</hi> 6. 4, 5. and alſo come to be with him raiſed up from death, that is, into the clear enjoyments of God, where we are made to live in the God-head, from it living in us (<hi>John</hi> 14. 17.) then doe we fully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and know this Chriſt, and this eternall Life, and not meerly for a man to conceive, becauſe the Srip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures doe declare, that this Chriſt is come, and the Creature aſſenting to the whole hiſtory, and believing of it, that this is the knowledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Chriſt, which is eternall life; for unleſſe the Creature know him ſo to be to him, <hi>that is eternall life to him.</hi> Col. 3. 3, 4. that as the Scriptures do declare him ſo to be in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him; ſo the Creature findes it true within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, from the experience of him in his own ſoule: his knowledge is but carnall, not living, ſpirituall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg; for that man that Reſts upon him, as he is declared in Scripture; before he be revealed within his ſoul, both that mans Reſt and knowledge is but carnall and fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for we ſee that all men almoſt in <hi>England,</hi> or in any place where the Goſpel is but publiſhed, doe believe that he is crucified and is riſen; and this they know from the teſtimony of Scripture: but doth every man know the minde and myſtery of truth? Doth God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale it to every one? Can any know the minde of God in theſe particulars, either by the Hiſtory or any other way; but by the Spirit of God? then it muſt he, that
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:153757:28"/> before this Chriſt come to be ſpiritually known, hee muſt be ſpiritually revealed within mans heart (1 <hi>Cor. 2. 10. Gal.</hi> 1. 16.) So that to hear of a Chriſt, and not to enjoy him, from being revealed within, is but very unfafe and unſound knowledge to Reſt upon; and that which brings not along with it eternall Life, as witneſſe, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 1, 2. He clearly expreſſes, that this Chriſt which is eternall life, was made manifeſt unto them, and was their knowledge of, from which know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, they had fellowſhip and communion with him: 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 3.</p>
               <p>This knowledge is ſpirituall, and according to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpiritually revealed, before it be truly and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally known, now the Sriptures doe not reveale Chriſt within any man, neither doe ſay the yto any particular ſoule, thou ſuch a one, Chriſt died for thee: but it is the ſame ſpirit which did declare the Scriptures, which muſt reveal what this Chriſt is.</p>
               <p>Secondly, What the myſtery of God in his ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; or what myſtery God did hold out, in the figure which was his fleſhly coming too and for thee in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, Thou muſt doe as he did, <hi>paſſe from death to life;</hi> and after being buried with him, before thou live in the Kingdome of heaven with him, or indeed know what that Kingdome or place is, which men car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally conceive to be above the Skyes, though the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall knower of him, knowes it in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nother place: Now what is it for a man to fill his head full of the hiſtory, concerning the birth and death of Chriſt, unleſſe this Jeſus a Saviour, or this Chriſt which is the light and glory of God, be diſcovered and revealed within him, ſutable to that precious Teſtimony, of <hi>Pauls</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this Chriſt. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 16. where he ſpeakes of this Chriſt to be revealed within him: for Chriſt as he was in the fleſh, cannot be revealed; but Chriſt as he
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:153757:29"/> is in the Spirit; or Chriſt as he is the great deſign of God, typified out in the fleſh, and revealed in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; either as a light, or as life; or as he is the breath of God, or as he is the clear manifestation of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in man comes to know him to be his Jeſus, that is, his Saviour, or inward deliverer; or wherein man clearly beholds, <hi>The Father in</hi> him, <hi>and he in the Father, John</hi> 24. 11. which cannot be diſcerned as he was in the fleſh; but as he is in the Spirit: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 8. that being a figure thereof: wee ſee this knowledge the Apoſtles wanted, when they ſaid, <hi>Lord ſhew us the Father: John</hi> 14. 8. they having no more knowledge of Chriſt, but as he was in the fleſh: they knew not that the Father was in him, and he in the Father: <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 11. upon this knowledge were they Reſting, when they ſaid, <hi>Lord it is good for us to be here:</hi> Mat. 17. 4. when they would have been making Tabernacles of Reſt, before Chriſt did transfigure himſelfe within: but Chriſt bids them, <hi>Ariſe let us goe hence,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, This is not a proper Reſt for you: <hi>John</hi> 14. 31. It is a very low diſpenſation: goe, I will diſcover my glory to you by transfiguring my ſelfe within you; then ſhall you ſee partly the myſtery of my ſelfe; then ſhall you more ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually underſtand and know me.</p>
               <p>And alſo ſometimes the carnall and fleſhly know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; the Apoſtles had then, put them upon carnall conceptions, as in theſe phraſes expreſſed, <hi>When wilt thou reſtore the Kingdome to Iſrael?</hi> And many more expreſſions; as deſiring <hi>fire</hi> might come from above; where Chriſt tels them, they <hi>knew not of what ſpirit they were:</hi> the one place tels them they looked upon him as to be one who was to have a great power in the World, namely, To be an earthly King, to live in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward pomp and glory; the other doth ſignifie, they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not the great deſigne of God in his coming: ſo as they in this diſpenſation were very low, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:153757:29"/> are in our daies; and would gladly have been Reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the knowledge they had, which was Chriſt in the fleſh, that was known by them, and declared and preached by them alſo; but ſtill they remaining under the clouds, and ignorant of the myſtery of Chriſt, in reverence to his coming in the Spirit: yet God was daily leading them to behold their ignorance; and more into the Myſtery of Jeſus.</p>
               <p>So that though men pretend to eſcape the common pollutions of the World, by ſuch a knowledge of Chriſt in the fleſh, yet it is not a ſecure eſtate; but a low diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, which wil diſſolve in a higher appearance of God. Therefore though men both know and beleeve that there was a Chriſt crucified in the fleſh, yet let them not Reſt, untill they know it in Spirit: Then ſhall a man ſee <hi>Chriſt</hi> daily crucified before his eyes.</p>

               <p>Secondly, Never more falſe <hi>Laodicean</hi> ſecurity.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Never more pride and ſelf conceitedneſſe then at that preſent; ready to judge every one that were not in relation, in reference to Church communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be no Saints.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Looking more at the practiſe of Ordinances, and being members of Churches, then at the reall experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſuch a ſoule.</p>
               <p n="3">3. More longing after the encreaſe of members, then of their living in the <hi>Spirit</hi> which were members.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Judging every one, if they were but in and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch Relations, to be Saints, though they had lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, yea, indeed no experience of God at all; refuſing communion with ſuch, being not of my judgement, though they knew what communion in the Spirit was: and cloſed, yea, joyned with thoſe who were ignorant of it; becauſe they were Church members. This having been mine, and ſtill are many mores at thispreſent; what Church are they of? Are they Baptized? What judgement are they of? Which doth argue, both an Idolizing of, and Reſting upon, theſe poore diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of babes and Children.</p>
               <p>It hath been with me, and I feare hath been and is ſtill with many more, a coldneſſe of love to thoſe, yea, a condemning alſo, becauſe they have or doe not cloſe with us in every particular, in matters of Judgement, or formes of worſhip; though the parties live in very high enjoyments of God, and are paſſed theſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens and babes diſpenſations: and all this teſtifies, a Reſting upon our formes and manner of worſhip: as for inſtance, An Independent, ſo called, and an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt, and ſo many more; as the godly Preſbyterian and others under divers diſtinctions of formes; how bitter they are one againſt anothers; what a diſtance
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:153757:31"/> they ſtand one from another; witneſſe their preaching and printing, and in the ſame their bitterneſſe; Inſtance their refuſall to here or joyne one with another; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe their croſneſſe of <hi>ſpirit;</hi> what a ſmell of falſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples this of Reſts appears withall; and truly argues much deceit, and unpoſſeſſed like with God.</p>
               <p>If one either hath attained higher; or live in the uſe of Ordinances, waiting for the reall enjoyment of God, being lower; why ſhould that heart who hath ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enjoyed more or leſſe of God, have ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likeneſſe of any thing of God in him: ſeeing God is love, and he that dwels in the loweſt enjoyment of God, dwels in Love: but truly the being bound to formes, or bound up in formes, and the uſing of them before we be led unto them by God, occaſions all this Reſting in, and condemning of all that doe not in all things walk up into, and in the uſe of theſe formes and Church relations, which the letter of the Scriptures owns to be a diſpenſation of God.</p>
               <p>But Secondly, As this is the cauſe of, and doth much ſavor to be occaſioned, either by our being bound up in them, or falſly led out to them: ſo alſo it is occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the want of a divine principle within; whereby that principle of God might command our formes and Church relations; and not formes and Church relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons command the ſou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e; ſo as the Soule onely ſeeing ſomething in the letter, wanting a divine light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, to diſcover unto him, either the time, place, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or end; by this it comes to paſſe why he is darke in and Reſt upon, and is commanded by, and ſo bound up in the form repuired in the letter; being ignorant of truth in the <hi>Spirit:</hi> but to come more fully to the thing in hand: This, in my judgement was the Reſt of the Church of <hi>Laodicea, (Rev.</hi> 3. 17.) in her conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded riches; yea, in her inſenſible poverty: and thus it prevailes with many a heart.</p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:153757:32"/>
               <p>Firſt, When eſpecially the Soul hath been much under the Law, and hampred by the Law, and ſo kept in a cloude from the view of Goſpel truthes; and now come to ſee a clear truth in that which he ſo much oppoſed, he is ſo taken up with it, as he hath no peace untill he fals in obeying of it, &amp; ſo gathers peace, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Reſt in the ſame; thinking it is now got into a very high eſtate; and the very name of a member of a Church, together with the greatneſſe of the love of God in bringing this Creature to beleeve and obey, who was darke, oppoſite, yea, a deſpiſer of the ſame: this doth help forward his Reſt in this particular.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It conſiders and reaſons with it ſelfe, now I am got into the communion of Saints, and enjoy now their ſociety; which before it wanted fellowſhip with; and alſo from conſideration of the purity of the Ordinances it now enjoyes.</p>
               <p>It before was alive in the uſe of corrupted Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, now it enjoyes them in the purity of them; before in and amongſt a mixed people; or he <hi>had fellowſhip with devils (1 Cor.</hi> 10. 20.) now with Saints: but truly though this be a <hi>Laodicea</hi> condition, yet it is a falſe Reſt, for there is no true Reſt, either in the pureſt Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, or viſible relations, for theſe a man may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, and be ignorant of the enjoyment of God in them, as the wofull experience of many will ſeale unto, and teſtifie the truth of whatwe are ſpeaking of.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Another cauſe of Reſt in theſe relations, flowes from his continuall growth in Goſpel light, and his encreaſe and growth of knowledge; and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the whole bent of ſuch a ſpirit, is taken up with labouring after the knowledge of points of judgement, and with matters nice and curious, things which moſt commonly pleaſeth the fancy and underſtanding; and to know ſuch things it is his continuall ſtudy, and end of all his labour: when ſtill he wants the life and power
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:153757:32"/> of Chriſt in his heart; neither doth he know him, but either by his profeſſion or by hear-ſaies; not in any true way of experience.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Another cauſe flowes from his conceived peace and comfort he enjoyes in the ſame: and thus he reaſons, before I had no peace, either in conſcience within me, or from Ordinances practiſed by me; but now I enjoy much peace in my condition; when indeed he may have ſtopt the mouth of conſcience, &amp; his peace come in from a falſe ground not ſpoken from God; but drawn forth or Imagined in his particular practiſe. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a ſoule feeds upon an imaginary peace, when it is ignorant of peace truly manifeſted in the heart: and in this moſt commonly doe the affections blinde and bribe the judgement, and ſo peace remaines onely in the imagination, and not enjoyed by any powerfull manifeſtation. But if mens hearts in Church relations may ſo utterly be deceived, then it ſtands in need of theſe enſuing cautions. 1. Beware of making thy being a member of any Church, to be either evidence to thee, or ground of peace in thee: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let any conceive better of their conditions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are in viſible fellowſhips: and neither let their joy or peace be the more; unleſſe they doe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly enjoy more of the diſcoveries of God to them then they did before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Beware that thou thinke not thy outward uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in a viſible manner with Saints, is a uniting thy <hi>ſpirit</hi> more unto God, or God uniting himſelfe more to thee: or that for or in thy preſent practiſe, thou art got the nigher to God; leſt thou Reſt more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in thy preſent condition then before: for carnall ſecurity doth moſt commonly follow the moſt of men in thoſe diſpenſations.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Beware thou goe not before God leade thee: for moſt commonly when God leades man into formes,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:153757:33"/> when he forſakes them, he leades them out of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that diſpenſation God will appear in: therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware that thou be not led by thy owne imaginations; then thou ſhalt not be left in and bound up in formes, but ſhalt continue in them ſo long as God continues in the ſame.</p>
               <p>But many who live and make a God of their forms; they neither know when God leads or not leads; when God is preſent or not preſent, its all one if they can enjoy the deſire of their hearts, and that which ſpeaks peace to them, namely, Their formes and Church rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: It is to them, yea, its life and happineſſe in them. But in the next place obſerve;</p>
               <p>Though God do own all or the moſt formes and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations, yet it is but for a time, untill a higher diſpenſation appear, or the ſubſtance of that forme be enjoyed, and then God departs from it, and ſeldome or never appears in that forme any more; eſpecially if the ſoul be caught up into God: for as the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment formes, which were of Gods own appointment, and God was in them for the time they were to be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſo alſo they were to ceaſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When the ſubſtance thereof was come. <hi>Heb,</hi> 5. 18.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When a more glorious adminiſtration was and did appear; then did God both depart from them, and diſ-own them; and they no where to be practiſed after theſe two did appear: So it is with new Teſtament formes, they have and had their time, and yet have when God will and doth appear in them; yet it is but untill God appear in a higher diſpenſation, and bring the ſoul into a higher adminiſtration; then doe all ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes and whatſoever is Goſpel adminiſtration ceaſe to that particular ſoule, in the uſe of them what they were before; I would not be miſtaken, I doe not ſay they ceaſe to all and every perſon whatſoever; but to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:153757:33"/> ſuch a ſoule as is in this diſpenſation, namely, he who is caught up with God, and carried by God out of the forme; God ceaſing to appear to that particular ſoule in that forme: the Lamb leading the ſoul gently out of one diſpenſation into another, untill he be wholly ſwallowed up with God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Such a ſoule as can truly ſay, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of ſuch a forme is come in the Spirit, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes the ſame within him; for there are ſome formes and adminiſtrations, which holdes forth Chriſt in the Spirit to come: now ſuch ceaſes to be in the uſe of them at his coming: as thoſe old Teſtament formes did hold forth as we ſay, Chriſts coming in the fleſh; which was both the ſubſtance of thoſe formes, and a more glorious adminiſtration of God: ſo it was in the decreaſe of <hi>John,</hi> and the encreaſe of this more higher and glorious adminiſtration: ſo it ſhall be in Chriſt his coming in the <hi>Spirit</hi> into every ſoules heart: then theſe formes that Chriſt appeared in, in the fleſh, ſhall ceaſe in his coming in the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now ſome Goſpel formes doe ceaſe to none, but to ſuch as have enjoyed the enjoyment of Chriſt in the <hi>Spirit.</hi> For as Chriſt led the Apoſtles from the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle condition in his transfiguration; ſo he will when he appears transfiguring himſelfe in every heart; as the Apoſtles, ſo every heart ſhall ceaſe to make any forme, yea, the New Teſtament formes, Tabernacles to dwell in for ever; as many makes them now in our daies: alſo there are adminiſtrations which hold out Chriſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready come. Which</p>
               <p n="1">1. Is not to be practiſed before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is to be practiſed after his coming. As I ſhall name one eſpecially. It is the adminiſtration of Praiſe, which is alone the work of thoſe that are Redeem'd, and have the Scales of the viſion of God opened, and are caught up with God into Heaven, to ſing ſongs to <hi>Zions</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:153757:34"/> God in <hi>Zions</hi> language, by <hi>Zions ſpirit,</hi> in that <hi>holieſt of holies,</hi> which is the place of <hi>Zion,</hi> and thoſe brought into the God-head to ſing Praiſe: but now God in this condition is departed from them, to this heart, not to every one; being ſeen and enjoyed in theſe formes which doe hold forth his thus coming into the heart: now none but thoſe who doe enjoy God in a more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious diſpenſation, are to ceaſe acting in thoſe diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations or formes he yet continues his preſence to them in: for as God did ceaſe, and did not appeare in the forms of the old Teſtament, and they were no more to be uſed after the ſubſtance therof was come, &amp; God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in a more glorious adminiſtration: ſo will God depart and ceaſe to be ſeene in new Teſtament formes or adminiſtrations; when both the ſubſtance of them is come, and a higher diſpenſation do appear, leadind the heart out of them to a more glorious and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate enjoyment of himſelfe: This is <hi>to follow the Lambe whitherſoever he goeth:</hi> This is to hear a voice behinde man ſaying, <hi>This is the way walke in it: Iſaiah</hi> 30. 1. And to be <hi>led by a pillar of fire (Num.</hi> 9. 16, 17, 18.) and ſometimes by a <hi>Cloud</hi> to mans ſpirituall Reſt: and not to ſtand in and under one adminiſtration all ones daies, and to be in one place for ever: But to finde God leading daily from one forme into another, untill he bring the ſoule into the perfect enjoyment of him, who is the glory and ſubſtance of all formes: this, for the want whereof, makes many to make them their Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles and Reſt, yea, their home; yea, their God, peace and happineſſe; which if they be taken away, their God is gone, and their peace have taken its wings and flown away: this is the reaſon why many in Church relations have a name they live, and yet are dead; that is, they have a name of Saints and Chriſtians, but they want the nature of them; they have a profeſſion, but want a poſſeſſion: This is the reaſon why many come
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:153757:34"/> to have a burning up in their ſpirits, and are brought to a daily loſſe, they run faſter into formes and Church relations then God did leade them; therefore in them God leaves them; for this reaſon the expectations of many are fruſtrated, which cauſeth nothing but death and ſorrow, when they have longed and preſt out after formes; and being members of Congregations, and the enjoyment of pure Ordinances, thinking to finde ſo much in them, and to conceive ſo much from them; and when they come there behold nothing but drineſs and emptineſſe, and the want of God, and ſo have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered loſſe. This is partly the reaſon of all the rents and breaches in all Churches Congregated; and why they cannot ſtand, is becauſe they were not led by God into theſe formes; neither did they ſee God cleerly go before them; but ſome by affection, ſome by miſ-infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and ſome out of zeale; ſo that now very little of God appears, either in their coming in, continuing with, or parting from; thus being bound up in formes and living in them, and doting too much upon them, and rejoycing too much in them; and judgeing all that ſpeakes not for them, or joynes not with them: yea, this is the reaſon why we are devouring one another, becauſe we all doe not look for and expect that the glorious appearance of God will leade each man out of his diſpenſation and forme, though never ſo low to drinke into one <hi>Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let him that is ſo much either bent for formes, or wholly againſt them; beware that he doe not ſo dote upon them, as to neglect the <hi>Summum bonum,</hi> the chiefeſt good: and let every heart that is againſt forms, beware of theſe enſuing things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That his living above formes, be not a pretence of his own, and no true and reall thing; for many are mightily deceived in this very particular thing; they live ſo high, as they live above all formes and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:153757:35"/> in the <hi>Spirit;</hi> when alas they are yet living in a form of knowledge, ſcraped up either from their own induſtry, or elſe got from hearing others report their experiences or apprehenſions; and he preſently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it to be a truth, conceives it to be his truth, and ſo fals off, crying out and judging all thoſe, that live yet out of conſcince in the uſe of formes; not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying higher makings forth of God, and yet he hath but got a notion of this into his underſtnading, &amp; yet is ignorant of living or enjoying God in the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Let them beware of as great an evill on the right hand as on the left, and that is, That they be not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving upon an imaginary God, and not the true: for it is the way of the Creature to give ſo much way to his fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and imagination; that whatever it propoſeth to be God, it lives upon and rejoyceth in, and brings the Soul into deep and carnall ſecurity, with high imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of himſelf, being able to apprehend and diſcourſe of deepe and high things; and yet want the life and power of any one of them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Beware of Judging (if thou be broke off from formes) thoſe that thou haſt left behinde thee in the uſe there of. Confidering that God is in all formes of his own appoinment, and that their diſpenſations may be of God; and that they ſhall there abide but their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed reaſon. And therefore let thy carriage to them and thy judgement of them, be as much as poſſible may be without offence unto them, and for the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them; and that when God ſees a higher diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation fit for them, he will leade them into it: only my ſoule deſires they may not be ſo glued to them as to live in them; and not to waite for a higher diſpenſation from God, only in the want thereof, they are in the uſe thereof, God owning and appearing unto them in them; ſo that I could wiſh, the wiſdome of <hi>God</hi> may appear ſo in the hearts of thoſe, who doe pretend
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:153757:35"/> thus high to live in God; that it may truly appear to themſelves and to others; God led them into the ſame &amp; not themſelves. I have experienced both the contrary evils, and therefore I ſpeake; ſo that if God be love, as in his diſpenſation God is ſo to him that knowes it not, then it muſt break forth from us, if it be living in us: to look upon children and babes with a tender eye and reſpect; ſo as judgement may paſſe away; and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of burning, which is Love, may appear amongſt us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, As others are under mens Teachings, ſo looke thou be under the Teachings of the <hi>Viſion of God (Heb.</hi> 2. 3.) and that thou ſpeake or pretend to enjoy no more then is taught within thee by the <hi>Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of God; for in the want thereof, ſad experiences te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies, we Peecing and patching Religion and high no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions together, and make it their delight and joy. Oh the teachings of God doe open the very heart and the ſecrets of the ſealed Booke, and beleeve it, to live wholly above all in God: It is to live ſuch a tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent life, as is better and ſooner ſpoken then enjoyed and known in truth: for there muſt be ſuch a death within men, and a paſſing from death to liſe by man, that indeed men may hear of the thing, and get it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their imaginations; but to enjoy it in the true and reall manifeſtations thereof, many in this ſhall in their conceits be brought to loſſe: for to have the Scales of the Eternall brightneſſe and glory of God opened in the appearance of the <hi>Viſion</hi> in a mans heart; to have the very ſplendor and glory of the divine Being Revealed within man; and to be wholly caught up in the whole out of all things, ſo as the ſoule is wholly ſwallowed up with God in all things; ſo that now neither eye hath ſeen, nor care hath heard, neither by mans heart can be imagined, the depths of the life, glory and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch a heart; yet it is his common meate; and teaching of the <hi>Spirit</hi> within him; ſo that no man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:153757:36"/> teaching can reveal the life and center of ſuch a heart; but it is better experienced then can be declared, it is ſo tranſcendent a life and being. Yea, further, for any man to live ſo in God, as he enjoyes God in all, and ſeeth God the life and being of all; yea, it is not his judgement, but hee findes all theſe things effectually within him. For a man may be of the judgement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning living wholly in God to be the onely Life; and yet not to know this from the experience of the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons teaching within himſelfe. Now it is no benefit for any to be of this and that judgement, unleſſe he live in the clear enjoyment of the truth he is convinced of in his judgement and underſtanding: here is the glory of a Saint indeed, not to know a truth becauſe it is the judgement of any, neither becauſe it is his own judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but that he have within him the truth teaching of it to him, from the life and power of it in him. So he knowes the Sun to be the Sun, not from hear-ſaies; but he ſeeth the life and glory of it, having his eyes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to behold it, and findes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by experience the heat and powerfull operation of the ſame upon him, as well as upon the earth. So with Saints, they doe not receive their Life, Light or experience of God living in a Saint, from hearing of it, but God breakes forth in their ſpirit, and ſo gives them the fight of the glory, light and ſplendor of God within themſelves: So ſoule beware thou be not overcome ſo with hear-ſaies as to reſt ſatisfied with the meer notion of God and truths, and yet be at this time but a blazing ſtarre, who ſhall fall and ceaſe to be, what thou at preſent both to thy ſelfe and others ſeems to be; onely for a time thou may by this notionary light in thy underſtanding and judgement be a blazing ſtar to diſcover what thou haſt for the deceit of thy ſelf and others: and yet it is not the light of the being of truth in thee; but a borrowed light got from others, or in thy imagination, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:153757:36"/> which ſhall ſuddenly periſh; and then thou ſhalt be left in the dark, as a man in the Clouds, reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for the great day. Oh, to be Taught of God is a Jewel; it will teach Truth, and not lye.</p>
               <p>Therefore in the laſt place, It is worth waiting for, though thou waite in ſilence and in death, untill thou do enjoy it; leſt thou pretend to have that thou haſt not, and to enjoy that thou enjoyeſt not; for in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou ſhalt go with a lye in thy Right hand; and ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thy ſelf under vanity and lyes.</p>
               <p>Yet I would not be miſtaken, that either I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt formes in their time and place, and manner; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that I deny that a ſoul may attaine to ſuch a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enjoyment of God as muſt, yea all formes and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes may flye away and be diſſolved, though not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; and the perſon, forme, and uſe thereof, ſhall be ſwallowed up with glory.</p>
               <p>But I defire to compoſe the great difference that lyes in mens attainments, when they all cannot ſpeake one thing, or enjoy God in one diſpenſation; then they fall one condemning another, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <head>The Tenth falſe Reſt.</head>
               <p>THe next Reſt which in order we ſhall ſpeake of is, a Sutability to the externall letter, or ſome qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:153757:37"/> frame wherein this Creature takes his joyfull Reſt in the view thereof.</p>
               <p>Indeed when a man is wounded, yea, deadly unleſſe there be ſpeedy helpe, in this condition, the Creature will bee willing to enjoy any Chirurgeon for the Cure thereof: yea, him that but pretend faire, and by his skill do give ſome eaſe therein at preſent, and hopes for the future, though this party do it but to ſerve his owne ends, not from any principle of good to the party who is the patient; yet he being ignorant of his faire pretences, he heales up his wounds, though falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and afterward the wound breakes forth again, to the greater damage to the party. Thus it is with a poor, diſtreſſed, wounded, helpleſſe heart; whom it may be, God is a preparing for mercy; he lying in ſuch a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate condition, would gladly have his wound Cured by God; but there coming a pretended Phyſitian into the heart, ſpeaks like God; appearing to the Creature to be God; and to heale in the ſame way God heales Soules; yet the ſoul being ignorant, accepts of it and freely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaines it; whereby it comes to have a time of peace and Reſt: onely becauſe he apprehends his deſperate wound to be cured. And thus ſouls do in a time of ſtraights, accepts of thoſe proffers; when in another condition he would not; but at preſent, neceſſity put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſoul upon it: Now ſoules that live under the ſight of the want of God, would in the ſight thereof, be in a way to attaine God; ſeeks and preſſes to know in this caſe what to do; at laſt it lookes upon the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (in this caſe) to be the only Teacher; whereupon hee gives himſelfe to a diligent ſearching of the ſame; where he meets withall ſome places how the Saints were formerly quallified, and theſe preparations they had within them; whereupon he ſets a labouring with his own heart to bring it into ſuch an eſtate of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, humiliation, or repentance, with hungring after
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:153757:37"/> God; as alſo loathing fin, and having a wearineſſe and burthen under it; and when he hath thus done, hee runs to Scriptures, and ſeeing his condition ſutable to that, he makes Scriptures the ground of his faith, and ſo cures his wounds by it, and ſo drawes peace and comfort from it.</p>
               <p>Now the creature being ignorant of any other work, he wreſts from this Scripture influence, as is pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and from thence concludes his enjoyment of God; and that now from ſome perſwaſions of ſpirit, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes it to be the witneſſe of the Spirit; when indeed the creatures heart in this caſe is not upright, and he being in darkneſſe is not able otherwiſe to judge of himſelfe, or his condition; neither of his heart which do tell him, that this his ſutability is upright: but the ſoule wanting the manifeſtation of light, he is not able to paſſe true ſentence upon the ſame, but Reſts and man makes his habitation here: and though he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to make Scripture the ground of his thus belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, yet it is his quallifications and ſutability to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which is the ground of his thus Reſting and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving.</p>
               <p>Or Secondly, That which in this caſe the ſoule is moſt eſtabliſht in is, when it may be a Creature is in ſome ſad condition, a Scripture is caſt in immediately upon the ſoule, un-ſough-out, or laboured for; and this ſutable to the ſoules condition; from which there is ioy and peace: yea, ſometimes the heart is ſo raviſht with it, and ſo over come by it, as indeed it's hardly able to expreſſe its joy and peace; yea, ſometimes the heart is ſo overcome, as it cannot expreſſe it, or hardly knows for the preſent where it is: But here lyes the Angel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like deſigne ſometimes of Satan, to come in the ſame manner, and with the ſame effects to deceive, that God comes in with to ſave, and ſo transformes himſelfe into Gods ſhape: And one of the cheefeſt waies he hath, is
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:153757:38"/> to apply himſelfe in ſuch a way of working like God, as he may the moſt prevaile with the ſoule; and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble God, and ſo keep the ſoule much below God. Now Scripture way Satan thinking is moſt like Gods way, of any other; eſpecially when he brings in Scriptures ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the condition of the party: and ſo that he may cauſe the ſoule to beleeve, that at ſuch a time God was pleaſed to manifeſt himſelfe, by caſting in ſuch a Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo ſutable; ſo as now his transformed worke is the more ſurer, ſeeing it hath ſuch a foundation as this: yet this he doth of purpoſe to deceive.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Mans owne Memory or fancy being upon ſome ſerious meditation, may in the ſame manner and way bring, and repreſent before the ſoule ſuch a Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and here lyes moſt of the deceite of the fancy and and imagination thus to work: this way, there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Scripture into the thoughts of ſuch a ſoules fancy and imagination to drive on his owne Deſigne, makes it as it were a noſe of wax to apply it to what uſe or way hee pleaſe; yet he will make it the ground of his imagination and fancy: and ſo man this way, comes to Reſt upon a deceite and fiction, and not upon any ground in the glorious manifeſtation of God.</p>
               <p>Now Scriptures it is true, doe diſplay in a Myſtery, moſt Precious things; which if a ſoul did enjoy them, their thus enjoying of the Truth there diſplayed, would be a Reſt unto them: but ſo long as a man reads Truth in the letter without him, until he can read it in the Spirit within him, there is little cauſe of Reſt to ſuch a heart. As Inſtance, For a man to be overwhelmed in groſſe darkneſſe, and in this darkneſſe, the ſoule not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to behold the glory of God: Now from his reading in Scriptures, hee ſees God there expreſſed to bee a Light, and to be full of Glory; yet notwithſtanding from the fight of this in Scripture, though he want this light within him, and his darkneſſe to be expel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed out
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:153757:38"/> of him; yet he Reſts with the fight of this in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſatisfied, as though God were become light and glory in him, and had expelled all darkneſs out of him; and hee carried up to behold it truely and live in it: ſo that that I drive at is to unbottome any ſoul of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a noſe of wax upon the letter: and becauſe Chriſt ſaith in an upbraiding way, Search the Scriptures, for in them ye thinke to have Eternal life; ſo many now think to have this Eternall life in the Scriptures, or in ſearching of them; when indeed they are but a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony or a Record to ſet forth in a Myſtery what Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life is: And becauſe the Scriptures ſay, that weary ſoules are to come to Chriſt for eaſe and Reſt, therefore, every ſoul who in his own fancy and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, doth judge himſelf to be weary, may come to Chriſt; and ſo by his being weary, there is way opened for his coming to him.</p>
               <p>For Firſt, It may be the heart may be weary of ſin, becauſe it brings judgement or condemnation.</p>
               <p>Or Secondly, It may be weary becauſe of his long travel to, and waiting for Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It may be weary becauſe it can no longer abide in theſe diſpenſations of Gods leading.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It may be weary becauſe God comes not in his time, and reward it for its breathing after, and working to attaine God or Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now the ſoul being falſly led out by his owne heart, hee inſtead of coming to Chriſt, onely Reſts upon his bare apprehenſion of this in the letter, from his ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to it in his own ſpirit; and here he feeds and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines with eaſe, comfort and peace in his own ſpirit; and this hee makes his Tabernacle: Though it be true that Scriptures were given to be a viſible teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or declaration of God or Chriſt, according to which God workes in man, yet they were never given to bee an inward Teſtimony, or a Reſt unto man; but the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:153757:39"/> Truth of the letter muſt be both Revealed, Known and Judged of by the Spirit; and not the Spirit, eſpecially in Internals, by the Externall letter; neither qualifications in man ſutable to the letter in mans ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, is a ground of faith or Reſt, without an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Teſtimony and Manifeſtation by the Spirit of the Truth of theſe qualifications.</p>

               <head>The Eleventh falſe Reſt.</head>
               <p>THE next Reſt in order to this, upon which men Center their ſpirits, and makes their Tabernacles, is the uſe and applycation of the conceived and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned extent of Chriſts death; which being ſo fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the letter without any more, they beleeve it upon this Teſtimony; and here is the ground of their joy, peace aſſurance and Reſt.</p>
               <p>Now I ſhall not go about to ſpeake evil of any point of judgement, in reference to any particular factions, but to come to lay open my own experience, and falſe Reſts; which in ſo doing I may come to lay open a way, whereby thoſe that are led by the ſame deceite, may come to ſee it in themſelves, and ſo may from ſad experience, ſeale to the Truth of what we are ſaying: for many who have gone through this diſpenſation, and have beleeved this to be a Truth, when now alas they ſee, that they were both ignorant of what this Chriſt was, or what was meant by his death; wanting the knowledge of it in themſelves; now the terrours of death have, or doe ſeaſe upon them; and inſtead of being joy and peace unto them, it hath produced death and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in them.</p>
               <p>But firſt of all, This ſoul who is thus Reſting upon Chriſts dying for all, he ſees the Scriptures ſaith, <hi>Hee
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:153757:39"/> gave himſelf a ranſome for all;</hi> The concluſion is this, of ſuch a ſpirit, If for all, then for me; and this he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves: and this ſaith hee, is the ground of true faith; when he is altogether decived. For the ground of faith is ſomething out of the Creature, in God, before time, revealed and made manifeſt from God to the ſoule in time; upon which the ſoule builds his faith, Reſts upon it, and is kept unto all time in the glory and ſplendor of it: but the ſoul wanting this in a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular way of diſcovery, he makes the other the ground of his confidence for refreſhment, peace, ſafety and happineſſe: and he concludes,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That no true faith can be but this.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that none have any ground to beleeve but upon this ground.</p>
               <p>When the poor heart is altogether ignorant in his owne breaſt, of the manner of Gods coming to reveale Truth; yea, himſelf in his Son by his Spirit: whereas now mans ground of his happineſſe lyes not in a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtood Scripture without him, but in a right diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, revealed, and known God within him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This ſoul daily encreaſeth in the aſſurance of this his Reſt, by his daily ſtudy, paines and diligence wherein he fils his head with ſo much of the Scriptures, as indeed hee makes it ſo glorious, as it Conquers his ſpirits, and many more; into a follacing himſelf in this very particular, when indeed he is miſſing the cheeſeſt good, which is the life of him, who puts an end of all controverſy to all ſuch diſputes, when he comes to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the Spirit; But alas, before no marvell though the poore ſoule bee running from mountaine to hill, though hee forgets him who is the Reſting place of Zion.</p>
               <p>Therefore Soule, Thou that makeſt thy habitation amongſt the briers and thornes, and barren mountains, Ariſe, theſe are not thy Reſt, they are from a corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:153757:40"/> judgement, and therefore are corrupted, and if thou ſtay here they ſhall deſtroy thee <hi>with an utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction:</hi> all are not proper Reſts which are diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and manners of Gods leadings; but the pure pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Reſt is neither in any thing, before in Death and Reſurrection, but in the aſcendings of the heart and ſpirit of a Creature into God, by the deſcendings of God into the Creature; which did raiſe him from death and the grave, and now hath opened the Heavens to him by receiving of him into glory: for as Chriſt did not make his Reſt and abode in any carnall or fleſhly diſpenſation, though in the ſame he did enjoy the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſo no heart is to make that his Reſt which Chriſt did not make.</p>
               <p>Every heart ſo long as it lives below the glory of God, ſo as it is not glorified with God; is a heart centring himſelfe in a diſpenſation which ſhall be diſſolved: For both man in the diſpenſation of Chriſt in the fleſh, or in a crucified, buried, or raiſed Soule, is not to abide but in a glorified aſcended ſoule into God; where the life is the unchangeable glory and ſplendor of God, dwelling in man, glorifying of man, in which is the life and center of man, truly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably centred.</p>

               <head>The Twelfth falſe Reſt.</head>
               <p>THe next Reſt in order to this is, a cloſing with and drawing comfort from the promiſes expreſſed in the Letter of the Scriptures: This cloſing thus with, and applying the benefit of promiſes; the whole life, center, comfort, cauſe of joy, peace, duties, diligence, what not, to many a ſoule (and from hence when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny comes to declare their manifeſtation of God, all
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:153757:40"/> they have to ſay is) at ſuch a time a promiſe was made forth unto them, or caſt into their thoughts, by which they apprehend God, and cloſed with it, and from thence did draw comfort and peace from it; and this is all the experience of God that is manifeſted to them, or that they have: This cauſes abundance of Reſt and ſecurity to many a heart, and luls them a ſleep which is moſt commonly Satans way to apply himſelfe to ſuch a cure; for to cauſe a ſoule to Reſt below God; as is ſutable to a Soules condition; ſo he brought in a promiſe to Chriſt: <hi>He hath given his Angels charge over thee;</hi> &amp;c. Mat. 4. 6. Here he came to apply himſelfe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the condition of Chriſt. O when once a ſoule is brought into a Pinacle condition, wherein he is brought to ſee the glory of much, then Satan lobours to cauſe the heart to fall downe and worſhip him; hee coming ſmoothly, and bringing the Promiſes of God a long with him, to back the truth of what he doth: and here after the ſoule is betrayed by repreſented glory in a promiſe meerly caſt in from Satan; wherein the ſoule fals down, and worſhips the very cunning work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the high exalting of Satan: and in this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he is brought to ſee and apprehend high things, and is brought into a Pinacle to behold almoſt the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of every thing, made over by Satan to the Creature in a promiſe upon the ſoules ſubmitting to him; and upon this Pinacle he ſets him, that is, he cauſes him to Reſt: and ſo the poor heart being not wiſe in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is deceived and betrayed; though the actions, knowledge, light, joy, Reſt of this ſoule be glorious and for God in his own eyes; yet it is but Satans transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe into an Angel of light, reſembling or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in and working in the Creatures heart, in the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieſts manner and ſhape God workes in.</p>
               <p>But Secondly, Others being wounded in Spirit, and weary in ſoule, for the want of any glimpſe of God;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:153757:41" rendition="simple:additions"/> leaving no means un-attained, to get his ſoule cured and unburthened; and having Reſted upon many falſe props before, and being unbottomed of them; he tries this particular, it being of a higher nature, and more likely to ſpeake peace unto him, <hi>viz.</hi> a running to Scripture, to finde out ſome particular promiſes ſutable to his condition; and having found out ſome ſutable Promiſes, either preſently ſeems to ſpeak to him from a ſutable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in him; ſo it may be, being a conditionall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, or elſe the ſoule meditates a while upon it, and it runs much in his thoughts, and at laſt he cloſes with it, ſtrikes this load and burthen of his ſpirit, here he drawes comfort and peace from it; yea, it may be ſo much as indeed the ſoule is mightily overcome in his ſpirits with joy, and can doe nothing but rejoyce; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he Reſts, builds his faith as he cals it, and ſo concludes it to be a manifeſtation of God.</p>
               <p>I will not deny but God may make theſe waies if in truth, cauſe of ſupport unto a ſoule in his travelling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Reſt: But for a ſoul to ſtrike ſaile, caſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, and have all the waves in his heart ſtayed, and his very wearineſſe of ſpirit, at this preſent put to a period, is as if the children of Iſrael had ſtayed either beyond the red Sea, or when God gave them Manna, before they came to enjoy a reall poſſeſſion of the land of promiſe: though God did this either to refreſh their ſpirits and ſo to under-prop them; or elſe to give them it at the deſire and repining of their ſpirits, to ſee how they would uſe it, or abuſe it. Now this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a diſcription of a Saints Spirituall travell, though God ſhould cauſe a glimps of glory or heavenly Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na to refreſh a heart, to be given to a ſoule in the view of a Promiſe, yet for a ſoule to Reſt in this, and make it his habitation, it ſmels too much of mans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite and abuſe of every diſpenſation, and a daubing up his ſpirit with untempered morter, and ſo hatches
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:153757:41"/> 
                  <hi>Cockatrice Egges,</hi> and weaves the <hi>Spiders Webbe;</hi> ſo that it is but a kindling of a fire, &amp; man warming him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his own ſparks; whoſe concluſion ſhall be death and ſorrow; and before ever the creature know what true Reſt is, by ſweet experience, hee muſt be brought to a death in all theſe.</p>
               <p>But from my own experience of the fallacy of my own heart, and the contrariety of the falſe Reſts that I have gon thorow; I make bold to propoſe theſe enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particulars to ſuch a heart; not intending to weaken the workings of God in any poor heart, though under low Adminiſtration; but only to diſcover the nakednes of man in the way of his own heart.</p>
               <p>And Firſt of all, When did the Lord manifeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to thy ſoule, and give thee a particular right unto, and intereſt in this promiſe; the application of which thou makeſt thy Reſt?</p>
               <p>Secondly, How was God Revealed to thy heart in this promiſe? Or whether is it not the great neceſſity thou haſt of it, that makes thee fly to the promiſe; and ſuck ſweetneſſe, life, comfort, and Reſt from it? Or is it God in Chriſt clearly Revealed unto thee in the ſame? For it was neceſſity, that made many run to the Ark, and hang upon the outſides thereof, though none but thoſe that were within were ſaved. Scribes and Phariſees did challenge a propriety in God, and all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall priviledges; but it was but from a ſutableneſſe of holineſſe, they had to the promiſe; and not Revelation of God in them, diſcovering the Truth the of God to them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, What inward Teſtimony of God haſt thou for thy great joy, peace, Reſt? And what is thy inward Evidence, that witneſſeth the truth of what thou enjoyeſt? For every one that beleeveth, hath a Teſtimony within himſelfe, 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 10. And every heart that hath ever ſeen the appearance of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:153757:42"/> him, hath found a lively Teſtimony coming along with that Manifeſtation of God; which is the only proofe of the truth of what he enjoyeth, and not any Qualifications, nor outward Teſtimony either of man, or from man, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 24.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, How was peace in this particular enjoyed by thee? Was it from ſome inward Voyce of God, or diſcovery of the ſame? Or was it from ſuch a ſutable form of words to thy condition; either caſt in, or found out in ſearching? Or was it from a clear Manifeſtation of the glory of God in thee, ſutable to thoſe formes of words in the Scriptures without thee; whereby the forme of words came to be made good to thee: ſo that thy comfort, peace, ſatisfaction, or Reſt, do not flow from the forme of words, as thou ſeeſt them in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture without thee; but from the enjoyments of God within thee, ſutable to that without thee?</p>
               <p>Fiftly, What glorious power of God was made out in thy ſpirit, in thy thus cloſing with Promiſes? Thy thus cloſing may ſeeme to be done in power, but the ſpirituall Coming of Chriſt in the manifeſtation of his glory, is ſo great, as indeed it is not ordinary, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, in the heart of him that knows his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>A Promiſe Cloſed with before Chriſt come in the Spirit, may ſeem to be done in glory and power; by reaſon it may be, hee could not before beleeve, nor live in that freedome or joy he now lives in; but the coming of Chriſt in the Spirit, doth ſo farre ſurmount that, as indeed the other appeares nothing, when this is come, <hi>Eph. 1. 19. Mat.</hi> 24. 30.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, Whether is it the Manifeſting of God to thee, that gives thee a right to the Promiſe, and from this thou cloſeſt with God? Or is it that ſutableneſſe in thee to the words of the promiſe, that gives thee a being whereby thou cloſeſt with it? If it be the latter,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:153757:42"/> it is not right: For all Promiſes are in Chriſt <hi>Yea, and Amen.</hi> And He is the ALL in them; and if hee bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, he gives a being to them: yea, to the creature to live in that being, as He is the ALL in them. So that the ſubſtance of every promiſe muſt come into the ſoule, and be Revealed in it, before the form of words can truly pronounce comfort, peace, life, happineſſe or Reſt to it: So as his Reſt is not upon the form of words, as in Letter expreſſed, but upon the Being of it; which is God manifeſt.</p>
               <p>Now many a heart doth feed, upon husks, out-ſides, and externall formes of words; and fals ſhort of being caught up into his glory, and ſo Reſting in the being of all Truth. Here it comes to paſſe, that the Creature makes every thing a God; and will ſhape and form out God according to its imaginations; and ſo labours to diſpoſſeſſe God, and to ſet up its owne ſhape in Gods ſtead.</p>
               <p>Now Promiſes, whether they be ſought, or caſt in, they are to be no Reſt unto any heart: for the words of the promiſe are like unto a figure or type, it teſtifies ſomething to be given to the Sons of men; but when a ſoule is in the poſſeſſion of thoſe things, then it doth not rejoyce upon the words holding out the thing; but upon the ſubſtance of the thing poſſeſſed in the heart: but many on the contrary hand, for the want of this, runs after conditionall promiſes; and when it ſeeth not the condition of the promiſes performed in it, hee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours after a ſutableneſſe to them; before not daring to apply them: but when hee hath got his heart into ſuch a frame, as he imagineth to be ſutable to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition thereof, he Reſteth there; applying life and comfort from it; concluding he hath a right unto it from this particular: But if at any time he breake the condition, his peace is gone; becauſe the cauſe of his peace, was his exact performance of the condition of the promiſe.</p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:153757:43"/>
               <p>Secondly, But ſome are higher then this, and they ſee a vanity in this; and they look upon Chriſt as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fermer of the condition; and if he can but beleeve, Chriſt hath done it, and then hee hath a right unto the fame; whereupon he uſeth meanes to get his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment convinced of this, that Chriſt died for him; and in Concluſion, he gets himſelfe convinced of the ſame, and here Reſts Concluding the promiſes are his, becauſe Chriſt in his: when indeed both the ground of his concluſion and confidence is falſe: and ſo he comes to be deceived.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Another, that Reſts upon promiſes before Chriſts ſpirituall Coming, is when a man hath layne in ſad darkneſſe and bondage, and hath a long time waited for a diſcovery of God, and at laſt ſome apprehenſions of Chriſt comes into his underſtanding; whereupon he ſtands convinced in his owne judgement that Chriſt is his: Whereupon hee for the greater encreaſe of his Reſt, Comfort, and Peace, runnes to promiſes and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes them, as having a right to them in his owne ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions by Jeſus Chriſt: Here is that which begets the ſtrongeſt confidence, that Chriſt is come in the Spirit; which works that joy and peace, the ſoul thinks ſhall never be taken from him; whereas after a while man is not ſo quick fighted, nor ſo cleare enlightened, but it ſuddenly lyes in the grave, as that which muſt vaniſh in the ſpirituall appearance of Chriſt in the heart.</p>
               <p>Now this is the great deſigne of Satan, to keepe the poor creature on the out-ſides, the husks; and would have the Creature wholly to live below the glory of Truth; which is the coming of Chriſt in the Spirit of glory: But hearts truly principled before Gods appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, are made to waite for him, from a great power of himſelf; not in any of theſe things to Reſt, before they in the glory of the Spirit come to Enjoy him. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 10.</p>

               <head>The thirteenth falſe Reſt.</head>
               <p>THE next Reſt in order to this, Is great, ſtrange, and excellent flaſhes of God (ſo I tearme them) and as they the moſt appear; yet they may be true, or falſe, reſembled, or reall.</p>
               <p>Firſt, We ſhall ſpeak of Flaſhes of light in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: And neither touch them as they are true, or falſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If they be but flaſhes, they are no reall mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſtations of Chriſt in the Spirit: and therefore in the firſt place, They are not of a Witneſſing nature, they bring no reall Teſtimony of God along with them; but leaves the creature dark and empty, in and of this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; but Chriſts coming in the Spirit is not without a Witneſſe, which is both unreſiſtible and ſatisfactorye but flaſhes whether they are of God, diſtinct, or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite; they have no Teſtimony of the Spirit, to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe the truth of God to man, by the Spirit withi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> man: as man is below under the diſpenſation of a flaſh, whether true or falſe.</p>
               <p>So ſecondly, They are not of a powerfull Nature; they are very weake in compariſon of the power of Chriſt coming in the Spirit.</p>
               <p>For firſt, They do not diſpoſſeſſe Satan of his habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whereas the coming of Chriſt in the Spirit doth <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 28, 29.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They do not diſpoſſeſſe the Creature of living in himfelf; or they do not carry up the Creature into the glory of God in the Spirit; they being of too low a nature, no more then flaſhes in a dark night, can bring the Creature into the beholdings of, and living in the glory of the Sun: ſo that they are not compleat Revelations of glory; neither powerfull in effecting the ſame worke, which is accompliſhed in the coming of Chriſt in glory.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:153757:44"/>3. They do not ſatisfy the heart of any; they may ſeemingly give contentment for the preſent; yet the ſpirit not altogether ſatisfied: whereas the coming of Chriſt in the glory of the Spirit, doth fill and ſatisfy the heart of any in whom he appeares: <hi>Mal. 3. 10. Mat.</hi> 5. 6. yea, his coming cauſeth a running over of the ſouls Cup: yea, it is uncontainable; mans capacity not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to receive or comprehend the ſame: for the want of this ſatisfaction, power or witneſſe of the Truth of Chriſts coming, he being but under a flaſh, he runnes to Miniſters and men of experience, to heare their judgement, being not ſatisfied in himſelf; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their approbation and judgement, he moſt commonly receives the more or leſſe ſatisfaction; and ſo reſts: whereas if it be Chriſts coming in the Spirit, a ſoul need not run to any Creature in the World to bee ſatisfied in the Truth of what is diſcovered; for HE comes with a Satisfactory Witneſſe; which doth anſwer all objections, and ſatisfy all doubts in the heart, which may ariſe: yea, If men inſtead of approving, do deny it to be Truth; yet the ſoules Teſtimony within it ſelfe doth bear up his ſpirit, that he is able to ſay, All men belye the Truth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 16. he not in the leaſt being daunted in his aſſurance thereof; though it be oppoſed by man or devil: neither can ſuch a heart be ſhaken, if all the men of the World ſhould ariſe againſt the ſame, coming to diſprove it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 25. 30. Alſo he that runs to any viſible externall Witneſſe, pretending Chriſt is come in the Spirit, is a creature altogether ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of his ſaid coming; and lives much below ſuch a coming: for to me this is an infallible Truth, that if any man pretend Chriſt is come into him in the Spirit, and yet wants an inward Teſtimony or Witneſſe for it; and ſo is forced to make uſe of viſible Teſtators, he is a man plainly wanting the enjoyment of the ſame; for God in ſuch a caſe never leaves himſelf without a ſure,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:153757:44"/> ſatisfactory, unreſiſtible and undeniable teſtimony; which indeed the Creature who wants the ſame, may well make uſe of others. But flaſhes if they be deceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, pretends to come in with a witneſſe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore many cals this a witneſſe; they being perſwaded of the truth of what it enjoyes: But this is as much below the witneſſe of the ſpirituall coming of Chriſt as the light of the ſtars, is below the light of the Sun. How many under a ſtate of flaſhes (which I may ſay is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the laſt Carde Satan can play in a ſoule to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him in his transformings) doe live in moſt great joy, light, notions, or pretended liberty; thinking from a meer perſwafion they have within them, they live in very high enjoyments, and doe beleeve they have a witneſſe of the Spirit within them, for the truth of what they beleeve; when indeed it is but a formed imagination, and a Card plaid gallantly by Satan, to keep the Creature below the enjoyment of God in the Spirit, and to live in freedome and Reſt; when not in truth and in the Lord. Further this is the reaſon part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of many ups and downs in the heart, whereby the Creature is one day beleeving, and another day doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe it is not living in the enjoyment of Chriſt in the Spirit; but may be is under ſome flaſhes, and ſo it comes to paſſe that it is unſetled and unfixed in <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Flaſhes are of no long continuance, they are not of an enduring nature; for they preſently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, are preſently gone; and ſo though the Creature had a great deale of light and joy; yet when the flaſh comes to be taken away, away goes all the Creatures joy and light, and he is left in the cloudes of darkneſſe and ſorrow again. Whereas when Chriſt comes in the Spirit it is not ſo, then all ſorrow and mourning ſhall flee away, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 60. 19, 20.) and the darkneſſe of the Creature ſhall be expelled; and God ſhall become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſoul an everlaſting lights <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 3. 24. ſo that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:153757:45"/> God and the Lamb ſhall live in his heart, and be ſight and glory to him; ſo as his Sun ſhall never goe downe, but he ſhall live in the light of God, and the Lamb for ever and ever</p>
               <p>For his coming in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> is after the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a ſoul out of the grave, whereby he is carried up in the light and glory of God, from the deſcendings of that light and glory from God; ſo as there is a living in the light God lives in; and a ſwallowing up in the fame glory God is ſwallowed up withall: but a flaſh leaves in its withdrawing the Creature in the ſame it found him in, if not worſe: for a flaſh of light or joy, is like a flaſh of light in the Skye; upon the darkeſt night it appears to be the greater the greater the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is: So upon a dark ſoule, when its poſſeſſed with much darkneſſe, the leaſt flaſh that can appear in that is very great and admirable; ſo that the heart being no otherwiſe able to judge, lookes upon it as a manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, yea, may be a very glorious one: yet it is not ſo, &amp; at laſt is taken away, and the Creatures hopes and expectations is fruſtrated. Whereas to ſuch a ſoule as lives in the day naturall or ſpirituall, hardly can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne or take notice of ſuch a flaſh or light, becauſe it is ſo much inferiour to the light and glory of the Sun, and day; which now is appeared and ſhines either within him or without him.</p>
               <p>Theſe flaſhes in the firſt place, if they be of Satan, the very end thereof is to lull the creature aſleep in the bed of ſecurity, and there is no reſting of the ſame by any poor creature: For</p>
               <p>Firſt, It workes and comes in ſutable to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures neceſſities, pretending redreſſe for the ſame.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It comes with a glorious reſembled form or ſhape God workes in; and ſo it becomes a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Satan, and not a transfigured Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is not able to diſcern the ſame by reaſon
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:153757:45"/> of the abſence of the true light which makes all things manifeſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 13. yea, the very transforming of Satan.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Flaſhes in this nature doe come with furniture to back the truth of what it doth declare or ſpeak; if there be any jealouſies ariſe in the heart, as ſometimes there is, yet it doth furniſh him with ſtrength to mannage the entertainment of it, and his joy and peace from it: and here Satan plaies his parts for if the heart be of an opinion, that it is poſſible for a ſoule to doubt after he hath enjoyed a manifeſtation of God, then he will put a Creature upon doubting, to make good that falſe, un-ſound, and un-experienced principle of men; that the trueſt faith is accompanied with the greateſt doubtings; and here the heart is ſtill deluded, and kept in ſtrong perſwaſions of the truth of his flaſh.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the heart be of that judgement, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that a ſoule can doubt againe after he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed a manifeſtation of God; then Satan will tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme himſelfe into a capacity of confirming the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in labouring in all transformed actions, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the creature in his aſſurance of the truth of what he enjoyes; and ſo upon all occaſions addes to what he hath done; and ſo the poore Creature Reſts ſatisfied in and upon what the Creature cals his manifeſtations of God: now flaſhes that uſually attend a Creature that is truly enlightened by God, though not fully poſſeſſed with God, yet he being waiting for the comming of Chriſt in the Spirit, is ſometimes attended with flaſhes or light of joy: but they if from God, moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have theſe enſuing effects</p>
               <p n="1">1. They doe underprop and ſupport a weary faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirit, in his ſpirituall travell to his land of Reſt, ſo as he is made to waite with free ſubmiſſion to God untill it enjoy an appearance of God in the Spirit.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:153757:46"/>2. Inſtead of cauſing a man to Reſt, they declare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; and doe diſcover the vanity to it of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reſts it hath been Reſting upon below the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God in the <hi>Spirit;</hi> ſo that it is ſo farre from it, as it, as it is an Angell appearing, unto whom man would gladly fall down and worſhip (<hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 10. &amp; 22. 8.) yet it ſaith to the Creature, as the Angell ſaid to <hi>John, Worſhip me not:</hi> ſo ſaith the Flaſh, Reſt not upon me; I am but as a Meſſenger from God; I am not the Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God appearing in the Spirit; I am in the forme of an Angell, I am not the God upon whom thou muſt Reſt and worſhip.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Flaſhes from God, begets a higher breathing in the ſoul, and a greater diſ-ſatisfaction in the ſoule until it come to enjoy an appearance of God in the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> of glory: it is ſo farre from cauſing a ſoule to Reſt, as indeed it workes a contrary frame of <hi>ſpirit,</hi> which is, a reſtleſneſſe in the heart, untill it come to enjoy that which in the flaſh is repreſented to it: alſo if ſo be that there hath been any with-drawings back of the heart from ſeeking after God; this Flaſh doth mightily ſtir up the heart of that Creature from that principle of the contrary nature, namely, a breathing after, and a reſtleſſe ſatisfaction, untill it come to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>THe next Reſt in order to this which partly the Creature paſſeth through, is the appearance of God in formes and adminiſtrations, under which the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is mightily ellevated in his <hi>Spirits;</hi> as <hi>Johah</hi> was with his <hi>Gourd</hi> which God gave him; which workes a great diſpleaſure in the heart; when God would have
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:153757:46"/> the Creature brought into a higher diſpenſation of God. Adminiſtrations I muſt confeſſe are appointed by God, and in the ſame he uſually appeareth in a low manner; ſo as hee ſometimes doth give the Creature much refreſhment in the uſe thereof; but not to bee the Soules Reſt, as though this were a full manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God in the Spirit; but to ſet the heart in a frame to ſee by this, the great glory that ſhall be revealed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, in the Coming of Chriſt in the <hi>Spirit:</hi> for thus it workes, If God be ſo glorious in a glimpſe of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in a forme, how much greater will be the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of himſelf in the <hi>ſpirit;</hi> which inſtead of Reſt, thus working, it is made to have a higher breathing in its ſpirits after the Reſt, which he ſees afterwards to bee enjoyed from God: ſo that the heart is led by God through thoſe many diſpenſations of God, to ſee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond them; Reſt to be enjoyed from God, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be enjoyed in theſe low Adminiſtrations, under which he breaths and lives: but others, they inſtead of this, Reſt highly ſatisfied in their ſpirits, making it their glory and Reſt of ſpirit to be an enjoyer of thoſe Adminiſtrations, and appearances of flaſhes in the ſame; making it the ground of all their Reſt: yea, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it their God of Reſt. As though the Children of Iſrael ſhould have ſaid, Here will wee Reſt, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving we are in the Land of Canaan; when God led them under, and through thoſe many Adminiſtrations by appearing in the forme of a Cloud of Fire; for I looke upon this to be the very ſymptome of this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Reſt, we are a ſpeaking of. I doe not condemne the Children of Iſrael, for their following the leadings of God in thoſe Adminiſtrations: neither do I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne any man who is in the uſe of formes; ſeeing God led them in, and unto the ſame; and that it is that which ſupports their ſpirits; namely, their ſeeing and apprehending God in ſuch a forme as the ſoul is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:153757:47"/> in; with theſe proviſoes: Namely,</p>
               <p>Firſt, The not Reſting here.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The not conceiving this to be the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Saints Reſt, but his way to goe, or to be led in his travelling towards the Land.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, His expecting of, and waiting for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt in the Spirit; which ſhall ſwallow up, and go beyond his preſent ſight of God in formes; whereby he ſhall come to poſſeſſe the ſame in that manner as is more glorious then his fight, which ſhall never be more taken away, or changed into another forme: But when a Saint who pretends to ſee the appearance of GOD, doth Reſt here; concluding this is the true Reſt, and the appearance of God in the Spirit; and ſo doth not only ceaſe waiting for another Coming, but oppoſeth and ſpeakes againſt it; This is a falſe Reſt, and not to be owned as of God: For the many diſpenſations Chriſt went through, before and after his death, yet his Reſt was not in the ſame; but was a waiting after hee was to have paſſed through theſe Adminiſtrations and Diſpenſations of God, to enjoy a higher then all theſe; which was his Aſcending into the glory of God in the Spirit, and to make this his habitation and Reſt: and to be as a ſtranger and pilgrim in all the other Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations in the fleſh; in which he did enjoy many appearances of God: yet hee paſſed through them all, and at laſt was made to enjoy his Reſt: which was the glorious enjoyment of God, after his aſcenſion into God farre beyond all formes and Adminiſtrations: yea, beyond the Manifeſtations of God in the meaſure thereof: And ſo Reſt in the ſame glory which is to be every beleevers Reſt: for the Reſt of Chriſt, is the ſame Reſt of every Beleever: and the ſame glory he Reſts and breathes in, is to be the Reſt and breathing place of every Beleever. And as Chriſt cannot, nor ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be changed into any other forme, then now Hee
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:153757:47"/> lives, Reſts and breaths in; ſo ſhall it be with every heart, who ſhall be truly centred upon God: He ſhall never be changed into any other forme, Reſt, or glory then he is in, when he comes to be truly ſtated in his living everlaſting Reſt; below which he is not to be looked upon either by himfelfe or others to be in any true ſubſtantiall Reſt: yea, though this do worke much peace and joy in the heart of ſuch a party, to ſee the appearance of God in formes and adminiſtrations: yet though a ſoule may delight here under ſome conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; yet to make this his Reſt and habitation, is to live in and upon <hi>Jonahs</hi> Gourd: or as if the Children of <hi>Iſr ael</hi> ſhould have reſted in the wilderneſſe, when God did refreſh them with <hi>Manna;</hi> and ſo in the ſame have made their habitation ſhort of the Land of <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an:</hi> for God appearing in the forme of a Cloude, or <hi>Pillar of fire,</hi> was not for this end, that they might make their habitation there. No more is the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of God in any Goſpei forme, but to be as that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall leading into a place where God ſhall appear in more fuller glory; and ſhall no more change his forme but ſhall appeare alwaies in the ſame glory in and to the ſpirit of ſuch a Creature: So that what changeable forme God is pleaſed to appeare in to us, is to be no Reſt or habitation of us; but to be led into higher en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, or after higher enjoyments of God, by the fight and appearance of him, though in a low or very meane manner in the form diſcovered. For the end partly why Chriſt appeared in divers formes to his Apoſtles, and ſo to many now; is becauſe he would not have any Reſt in or upon his forme, or appearance: but that they might be, as he was, dying to all theſe, and waiting for his aſcending into <hi>God;</hi> where he might be for ever ſwallowed up with the light and glory of God, and there to make his and all Saints habitation and Reſt.</p>

               <head>The fifteenth falſe Reſt.</head>
               <p>THe next Reſt which I ſhall ſpeak of is, The Goſpel Faith of Jeſus Chriſt (as men cals it) which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed hath ſome ground of Reſt, both from Scripture and reaſon, as they thinke.</p>
               <p>Men in our daies have given diſtinctions of Faith, as namely, Hiſtoricall, Temporall, and Saving. But leaving the two former, I come to the latter, and ſhall un boſome my ſad experience of deceit in the ſame.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Concerning this Saving Goſpell Faith. I owne their is a Faith, which in Scripture is termed Saving: yet that which men cals both beleeving and ſaving, I finde not to be ſo.</p>
               <p>And firſt of all, men cals true Faith, <hi>A dependance upon Chriſt,</hi> or beleeving Chriſt dyed for them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Scripture. Now Faith is neither a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy upon Chriſt, or beleeving according to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon expoſition, that Chriſt dyed for us; theſe, if they be ſo in the heart, as a Creature doth conceive, yet they are but the effects and fruits of Faith, in its ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall act, upon or towards God; but this many make their Reſt and ſhelter; that if they can but beleeve, Chriſt dyed for them at Jeruſalem; and that thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving they can goe out of themſelves; that is, onely deny their own righteouſneſſe, and beleeve that Chriſt is theirs, and that he dyed for them, this is a Reſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient: when indeed the poore heart, is both ignorant what Faith is, and what going out of himſelfe is. For never can a creature go out of himſelf to Chriſt or God, before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there be a cleere manifeſtation of God in the heart. Now the Creature who is thus Reſting upon his beleeving in Chriſt; is altogether ignorant of any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of God to him or in him. For Faith is a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall and divine light of God communicated to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:153757:48"/> the ſoule, by the Spirit of God; which after this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of light, the creature comes to ſee and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the glory of God; by which Faith he is made to beleeve; yea, which beleeving is an effect or act of the ſaid Faith, upon or towards the ſame God which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed.</p>
               <p>Now in the firſt place, Beleeving is not Faith; but an effect thereof.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Beleeying is an act of God in us to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfes and ſo no Reſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Nothing which flowes forth from man to God, is to be a Reſt. No act whatſoever is to be a Reſt as it is purely exerciſed in man though of God: but mans Reſt, is to be One who acts all in man, who is God. Many men are thinking highly of themſelves; becauſe the Scriptures declare a Chriſt crucified for man; and they are made to beleeve he was ſo for them, and ſo are made to deny their own workes of doings, and to depend onely upon this Chriſt; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> which indeed the poor hearts be ignorant of, and know him not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have any manifeſtation of Jeſus Chriſt in them, in any particular way; but onely from their own imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and fancies; they ſtill confidently beleeve that this Chriſt is theirs, and he dyed for them; and here they Reſt, and make their habitation; concluding this to be Faith, and the knowledge of Chriſt; which indeed if ſuch a Spirit knew what Faith were, or the knowledge of Chriſt were; this would be diſſolved, if not deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and it would finde it's faith and knowledge, to be an un-ſound and nn-ſafe Reſt to be centred upon. So that I ſay that that is not Faith, or beleeving which men ſo cals: and if ſo, it were no ground to Reſt upon.</p>
               <p>For, In the firſt place, A man muſt truly know within himſelfe what Faith is, before man can truely beleeve.</p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:153757:49"/>
               <p>Secondly, Hee muſt alſo know what this Chriſt is he beleeves in, before he can depend upon him and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve truly in him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There muſt be a cleare manifeſtation of God or Chriſt in man, before there can bee any true knowledge particularly of him by man.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Chriſts dying at Jeruſalem ſhall then bee known to the heart in a more ſpirituall manner then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: And the workings of that death, ſhall be found in that heart, to bee ſuch as formerly it did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, He ſhall know that dependency upon Chriſt, and his former beleeving in Chriſt, the truth of which he hath formerly tryed by viſible ſignes and marks, is now made to be a fancy, not Faith; and an effect of darkneſſe, not of light. And now he findes another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency, and beleeving in him, flowing from another ground then before he knew; and that the matter hee Reſted upon in his own imagination, which he before called a Chriſt dying for him, is now changed; being it was but his carnall conceptions, and fleſhly teachings and actings: and now he is made to ſee the ſpirituall ſenſe; and ſo to judge of the truth of an ever dying, yet ever living, transfigured, glorified Chriſt: ſo as now he is making his habitation, not amongſt the beaſts of the field, in his former fancies and fleſhly teachings; but in the ſpirituall heavens, where lives all Juſt men, made perfect; and all perfect men, made to live by, or in the life of God or Chriſt; ſo as he is changed into glory: and his Reſt is made glorious.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, When this is come to paſſe, men ſhall know really the Myſtery of Faith; and why it is called a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery: and that ſame ſpirit ſhall know a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Myſtery of Faith diſcovered to the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, coming as it were from God, and the keeping and exerciſing of the Myſtery of that Faith in a pure
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:153757:49"/> Conſcience to God: and that beleeving is not Faith, as it purely comes from God, diſcovering it ſelfe, and the Myſtery thereof to the Conſcience: But it is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of that ſaid Myſtery of Faith by God, in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God. So that the Myſtery of faith in it ſelfe is one thing, and beleeving and dependency upon Chriſt (if true) is another thing. But the effect or exerciſe of the Myſteriouſneſſe of faith in a conſcience which is pure, to or upon a God that is pure.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Men may beleeve Chriſt died for them, and from this beleeving may practiſe ſuch things as are required by him: yea, may have much peace &amp; joy in the ſame: And in this his own works, he may abh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This is the place of ſafety, where Saints Treaſure lyeth, and where they are to make their Reſt, habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and abode, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1. This ſafe Reſt is not procured by, neither is it a dependency upon one, a heard of Chriſt; but it is a carrying up of a ſpirituall, crucified Spirit, into a glorious God; who was, and now is made manifeſt, to live with, to Reſt upon, and to have a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation in, for Ever and for Ever: And here the ſpirit remaines in ſafety and in glory, triumphing in him, and being ſwallowed up with him, is carried up into the light and life of God; knowing him in all things, enjoying him in all things; ſeeing him to be the light and life of all things; being now gathered up into his will, is wholly diſpoſed by him; and therein with God is ſatisfied, and ſo Reſts: whereas mens beleeving is very unſound; and if it were not, yet its very unſafe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given to change: And being it is but ſome exerciſe of ſomething in man, yet it being but an effect, it is not to be a Reſt; but man is rather to be carried above it, after the poſſeſſion of him who can give Reſt, and eaſe all heavy loades and burthens of the creature, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28. 29.</p>

               <p>THe next Reſt we in order ſhall ſpeake of, Is the great Experiences many have of deliverances gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them by God, from inward and outward ſtreights; making them evidences of his love, and matter enough to conclude ſafety, Reſt and happineſſe; and in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:153757:50"/> there is ſome gloſſe, and ſeeming cauſe; as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſhall be produced.</p>
               <p>And firſt of all, we will come to ſpirituall deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, as</p>
               <p>Firſt, Inward conflicts of ſpirit; occaſioned either by a diſcovery of the want of God, or of a ſoules miſery without God; which occaſioneth condemnation and apprehenſions of wrath, and ſo ſorrow, mourning and griefe of ſpirit; in which condition the ſoul lyeth as in hel, being filled with horrour and fear: and looking upon God as nothing but a revenging and tormenting God: in which torments of ſpirit he lyes groaning and mourning before God; being ſwallowed up in darkneſs, and bondage, attempting all meanes to get freedome and liberty, from this his ſad, wofull and miſerable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate: wherein ſoules ſometimes get deliverance one of theſe three waies.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Either from extraordinary paines and diligence wherein he thinks if he could but do this or that, or attain ſo much humiliation or mourning or repentance, then he ſhould be happy and in freedome: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in concluſion he attaines (in his own apprehenſion) that which before he deſired: which ſtopping of the mouth of conſcience, and a breaking priſon before God deliver, together with a conceite of a Cure applyed by God; when indeed it is a curing the wound of ſuch a ſoul falſly; which in time will break forth to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter damage of the party.</p>
               <p>Or ſecondly, It is freed by ſome cunning Sophiſter of Satan, either immediately by himſelfe, wherein hee labours to apply a falſe remedy, thinking to put the ſoul thereby into a ſtate of ſecurity: or elſe mediately, by his inſtruments in the Miniſtry; wherein they come to daub with untempered morter, and ſo ſpeaks peace to man, before God ſpeak peace within man; and ſo doth as the Lord ſaith, <hi>Heal up the wound of the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:153757:51"/> of his People falſly;</hi> and from this have many poore hearts been miſtaken, when at any time they have been in and under ſuch torments of ſpirit; they have not reſted untill they have run unto Miniſters, to ſee what they will ſay; ſome of them putting them upon doing, ſome of them applying cures to them: and here a poore heart thinks to bee ſatisfied; where hee never Reſts, but runnes from one to another, from creature to creature, ſeeing if he can get any thing from them, ſometimes coming away with much peace, other times coming away with a leſſon of doing; and by theſe means comes ſoules ſometimes to have their deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, and for a ſpace Reſts untill it breake forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
               <p>The third way wherein many others attain deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is from God: As the children of Iſraell from their land of bondage, tiranny and task-maſters; which though God himſelf did free them, yet notwithſtanding was not to be their Reſt, but to be their firſt ſtep toward their Reſt: So though God do ſweetly deliver a Soul from, and out of this trouble and perplexity of ſpirit, yet it is not to be a Reſt unto him, or to be a habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for him to dwell in; but to be as it were the firſt ſtep to his Reſt.</p>
               <p>Now ſome mens deliverances are of God, and ſome of themſelves, and ſome of Satan; but none of theſe are to bee reſted upon as they are deliverances, ſeeing they may be true or falſe: which untill a higher diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of God cannot in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>allibly be diſcerned.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A Soul may be delivered from a reſolved ſelfe Murther or Deſtruction, when temptation doth violently attend that way; yet not withſtanding though hee bee abundantly preſerved by God in his inward ſtreight; wherein Satan would have him become his own executioner; yet it is not any ſufficient Center for any ſpirit.</p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:153757:51"/>
               <p>Or thirdly, If it be a deliverance of the creature from the wrath to come, preſently lying in the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the creature; yet not to be a Reſt, or any cauſe thereof.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If it be a deliverance of the creature from ſome violent corruption or luſt within him; ſo as now God hath as it were freed his ſpirit from that Lordly power of inward corruption, ſo as now he is freed from ſin, which formerly hath both diſhonoured God, diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured Truth, and taken away his peace. Now ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when this comes to be ſubdued, and the ſoul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the ſame, he Reſts upon it; and concludes from it great cauſe of ſafety and ſecurity; and as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Teſtimony of Gods love; and here he makes his center, when indeed the heart cannot have true Reſt in any deliverances wrought for it by God, but muſt be carried up above the ſame into the Deliverer, who is God; ſo as in inwards, ſo in outwards, bee it of what nature or quallity ſoever: yet many after the receipt hereof wax the more ſecure, make a God of their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances ct ſo Reſt upon them: with which though they were in love, yet they are not given for that end; no more then God delivering the Children of Iſrael at the Red Sea, ſhould afterwards be a ſtop unto them, and a center for them, before they came into the land of Promiſe: Or that deliverance of <hi>Daniel,</hi> or of the Three Children, or of <hi>Jonah,</hi> none of theſe were to be a cauſe, either of Security or Center; but to be rather accompanied by God, to put their ſpirits out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves after him, who was to be a Reſt unto them, and a Deliverer of them: ſo that the common, or ſpeciall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances of God, in theſe caſes are abuſed, and the end thereof dealt deceitfully with; and they are made that which God did not appoint them to be, <hi>viz.</hi> Reſts; and that which ſatisfies the creature with the receipt thereof.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:153757:52"/> yet in the ſecond place, I doe not deny this to be one of Gods diſpenſations; and the way he deales with ſpirits both to diſcover themſelves, with the vanity and miſery attending the ſame; where mans heart is made a heart of miſery, preparing for mercy; this being the way to Reſt and peace, happineſſe and glory; when God comes in the firſt place to free the ſoule from this his deliverance, though it be of God ſtill: as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the way to happineſſe, ſo his deliverance the way to reſt; that is the way to make the heart enter into it, and be centred in it: For though the Reſt in this deliverance be diſcovered; yet it may be long, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch a heart do enter into it: as <hi>David</hi> ſaith plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, return unto thy Reſt, O my ſoule, for the Lord hath delt bountifully with thee. Now though God may have dealt bountifully with a ſoule, yet that ſoule may not be returned, nor centred in his true and proper Reſt, though it be in a further worke then deliverance inward or outward.</p>
               <p>So that in the firſt place, many hearts it may be, have been in deep diſtreſſe of Spirit, in the pit where no water is, and now are it may be in ſuch a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as they are at great freedome and live in much joy; yet ſuch a heart it may be freed in his own ſenſe and yet intended by God, to be brought into his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer bondage and miſery; becauſe his wound is falſly cured; and having not been willing to waite Gods time, is faln thereby into carnall and unſafe ſecurity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore ſoules had need beware of falſe deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Satan that Spirit of deceit, may drive on his deſign in this particular; to have a ſoul delivered by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit; <hi>ſeeing</hi> before he could not prevent the cauſe of the ſenſe of his miſery; &amp; ſeeing he could not prevent that, he labours to deceive the Creature by propoſing, and working deliverance for it, before God deliver it: the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:153757:52"/> heart being willing to imbrace and to have deliverance before his time.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If this be not, but that God goes forwards, to make ſuch a heart a heart of miſery, and ſo prepare it for mercy, and worke admirable diliverances for it, both within and without; yet notwithſtanding it is not ſufficient the ſoule Reſt here; but ſuch a heart is to wait for a higher diſpenſation of God, this being Gods lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing way thereto.</p>

               <head>The ſeventeenth and laſt falſe Reſt.</head>
               <p>THE next and laſt Reſt which wee ſhall ſpeake of is, by ſome waited for, and by others pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be received: to wit, The extraordinary Gifts of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> whereby both worſhip without and God within, is confirmed, and in their apprehenſion ſealed up for truth.</p>
               <p>Now for my own part, I look upon both either in the condition of waiting for it; or in the pretence of the receiving of it, to be un-ſound, or an un-ſafe principle,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In a waiting way, there are, who are waiting to have the Spirit powred down, in ſuch a manner as they ſhall be able to doe miracles, and viſibly to caſt out devils. But I thinke this is a meere miſtake; for thoſe caſting out of devils and viſible powers given to the Apoſtles and Saints, was given only as a diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God, in that adminiſtration the Apoſtles lived in; and not to be any diſpenſation intended to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to any other, after that adminiſtration was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and ſetled.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thoſe viſible powers were given them for the confirmation of the Goſpel in a viſible forme, to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ale
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:153757:53"/> the truth of that forme of words, which was to be left unto all ages. Now if we had new Scriptures to write, and a new Goſpel to declare; then I confeſſe for the eſtabliſhment of the ſame; it would be neceſſary to have the ſame confirmed by viſible miracles and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. But</p>
               <p n="3">3. It was given to be a figure of the glorious manner of the workings of God in the ſoule; and the caſting out of devils and curing ſick, opening eyes, and the like (<hi>Iſa. 26. 12. Phil.</hi> 2. 13.) theſe were to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate unto us, that as the coming of Chriſt in the form of fleſh, was attended with theſe ſignes and miracles; ſo the coming of him in the <hi>Spirit;</hi> ſhould be attended with inward ſignes and miracles; to wit, internall and divine powers, the caſting out of the many devils with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; the opening of the eyes of the underſtanding, and the curing the wounds of the ſoule (<hi>Luke 24. 45. Eph. 1. 18. Iſa. 60. 1. Iohn</hi> 5. 25.) the opening mans eares to hear the voice of Chriſt within; to have a dead <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſoule raiſed up in the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Now the Reſt, was but as figures, though reall, of what God did hold forth ſhould accompany the ſecond coming of Chriſt in the heart, <hi>Mal. 3. 2. Mat.</hi> 25. 12, 13. And if ſoules did waite for this, their expectations ſhould not be ſo much fruſtrated as it is in the other, and ſhall be. And as for the great miracles that ſhall be wrought, muſt be within, and felt by ſoules, when Chriſt appears in the heart: So that theſe externall powers, ſhall be turned into theſe ſayings, <hi>The coming of Chriſt ſhall be with power and great glory:</hi> Mat. 24. 30. Now men are deceived I feare, who ſeeke for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in any carnall or fleſhly way; or that he will make that to be the powrings down of the Spirit, to wit, the caſting out of devils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it ſhall be more ſpirituall and heavenly; even the power of the <hi>Spirit</hi> within, to conſume mens luſts
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:153757:53"/> and ſelfe, and to caſt out all thoſe <hi>ſpirits</hi> of deceite, which internally doe lodge within the Creature: ſo that the letter which was confirmed by outward Signes after Chriſt appeared in the forme of fleſh; ſhall in the myſtery thereof be confirmed to and in us, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall workings &amp; miracles, which ſhall attend Chriſts ſpirituall coming in the Soul, and that in the Spirit. Now I ſay, that neither do mens waitings, appeare to be that which men conceive them to be; nor if they did enjoy that at the laſt which they waite for, it would not prove that to them, nor give that content, peace, joy, and cauſe of Reſt in them, nor aſſurance to them, which they expect from it, and thinke to attain when they come to attain it. I wiſh that men would turne the wheele, into the waiting for the inward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe things in a more <hi>ſpirituall</hi> manner. For my own part, I thinke they would enjoy more quietneſſe in their <hi>ſpirits</hi> for the preſent, and more ſettlement and Reſt, peace and ſafety in them for the future, when it comes to be experienced: But I think I may ſay thus much to ſuch <hi>ſpirits;</hi> that I thinke when they enjoy that they waite for, <hi>viz.</hi> the powrings out of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rti, from which to enjoy power to worke outward mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; it will be in the enjoyment thereof. But I ſhould be ſorry, to live without the enjoyment of God to that day; and I am confident all ſuch ſouls ſhall be weary before they ſee the ſame enjoyed by them.</p>
               <p>But Secondly, To all ſuch as have the ſame in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; I do not ſee how they can make them any ſafe Reſts; ſeeing that <hi>Saul</hi> and many others did goe as far in the gifts of Propheſie, or any other gift of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> any almoſt who did ſweetly enjoy God, and that was the cauſe why thoſe words were ſpoken, <hi>They ſhall ſay in that day, have we not propheſied in thy name, and in thy name caſt out devils, &amp;c.</hi> Mat. 7. 22, 23. Yet ſee the reply of Chriſt, he did not own them in the ſame;
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:153757:54"/> though they did make it their Reſt before, and their plea then; yet it was nothing, but that which proved both un-ſound and un-ſafe for them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The workings of Antichriſt and the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of iniquity doth worke withall deceivableneſſe, doing great wonders in the eyes of the world; yet alas it is, both for the deceiving of the party who hath it, and for the deceiving of the parties who beleeve it; witneſſe the worke of the <hi>Magicians,</hi> who when they acted the ſame things <hi>Moſes</hi> did; yet the parties who acted, &amp; the parties who beleeved the ſame, were both deceived: ſo though there were any in our daies, who could doe the ſame worke, that they or <hi>Judas</hi> did, yea, greater then they did, yet the parties might be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates and caſt-awaies: and however, they may be ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly taken away, and therefore unſafe for any ſoule to Reſt thereon: It muſt be the power of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and thoſe inward miracles, which God workes as the effect of his coming; <hi>viz.</hi> The caſting out of the devils within; and bringing down mountaines of pride and ſelfe; and exalting of his Chriſt in the ſoule, ſo as the ſoule is un-bottomed of all his falſe props, and carried wholly out of himſelfe, above himſelfe into the power and majeſty of that Chriſt exalted, to live by and in that ſame power and glory, by which God lives in the heart: So that I ſay, to look for outward powers in this caſe, as I and many more have done: or if they were enjoyed, to make them their Reſts, both are to me un-ſound; and every party as well as my ſelfe, ſhall finde the evill, and un-ſoundneſſe thereof.</p>
               <p>Now having diſcovered as many falſe Reſts as at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent I am free to diſcover, I ſhall in the next place ſhew how difficult it is, and how hard it goes with the creature, to part with theſe his falſe Reſts; which are falſe but in reference to his Reſting and abuſing the end for which ſuch a diſpenſation was given.</p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:153757:54"/>
               <p>The Soul being in the firſt place, as I may ſay, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht upon them, making them his God, bee they formes or what they will, when it ſeemes to bee taken away, he being brought to a non-plus in his ſpirit: He cries, They have taken away my God, What muſt I do? So that there ariſeth as it were a ſtorme within this creature, which begets a ſpirit of diſcontent in the creature: Witneſſe the ſame in <hi>Jonah's, Gourd</hi> which God had given him, yet being abuſed in the end for which it was given; in the taking of it away, there was a ſpirit of murmuring and diſcontent. And thus it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, when creatures would bee Reſting upon any thing below God; when God ſeems to take it away from the creature; The more the ſoul was glued to it, and Reſted upon it, and made a God of it; the more difficult and hard it goes with the creature to part with the ſame; yea, the more diſcontent doth ariſe in that heart.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, It ariſeth from the abuſe of our being glued to any Adminiſtration, ſo as not to uſe it to that end for which it was appointed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The cauſe partly of this ariſeth ſometimes from the greatneſſe of the loſſe it works in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in being to part with the ſame; as many ſoules it may be have ſpent the glory of their age and ſtrength, to patch up a Religion of their owne, and have taken much paines to accompliſh the ſame. It may be hath been twenty yeares a profeſſor, and hath all this time been labouring to patch up a Reſt, and having got one, in one moment God raſes the foundation thereof: this works ſuch a loſſe in the ſoule, as indeed to have many a glorious gift burned up; yea, many a glorious day of joy, twenty yeares profeſſion in one moment laid in the duſt; and now to deny it ſelf in all his paines, and parts of wiſdome and knowledge: This muſt needs goe hard and be very difficult with a poore heart, to part

               <p>The condition of ſuch a ſoul, is like a man that all his daies hath been taking pains night and day, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend ſome eſtate; and when he hath got ſuch an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, he fals a building, and makes great buildings; and when he hath furniſhed the ſame, takes delight in it, and ſets his heart upon it; and behold, when he is ſolacing himſelf in what he hath got and done: In a moment there is a fire conſumes the ſame to the duſt; which being beheldby the party, he is amazed, and much perplexed in his ſpirit; upon which occaſion in ſome it begets death, in others diſcontentedneſſe and murmurings; yea, repinings of ſpirit, ſo as it is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a day of ſorrow, but it continues ſo: And this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties loſſe being exceeding great, and his expectation fruſtrated, he is now at a non-plus, not knowing what to do: So it is with a heart after God either hath given gifts, or ſomething below himſelf, or for the which the creature hath been labouring all his dayes; and at laſt, having attained ſo much, as now he Reſts with the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> in a conceited happyneſſe: When God comes to burne down this houſe, the ſoule hath been all his dayes building, though upon (it may bee) a falſe foundation, he layes the Creature and his worke in the duſt; ſo as now the ſoul is ſtript naked of all his conceited holineſſe, or righteouſneſſe and happineſſe; u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

What is all my praying,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:153757:55"/> faſting, mourning and the like, all taken from me; ſo as now I have nothing to Reſt upon: Muſt I part with all? Oh, eſpecially this creatures riches is hard to part with, as it was with the young man who wanted all things, in the want of one thing; who notwithſtanding had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of the World, and I feare, too much of this wee are ſpeaking of; for he was nigh the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, yet to part with all for a Chriſt, Oh how loth hee was: Oh this parting with all goes hard, makes many ſorrowfull either in reſpect of outward or inward rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: It is moſt commonly this inward riches which is the life of moſt profeſſors in our dayes, until God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bottome them of their profeſſions, and forms, and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doings and fulneſſe: and the moſt that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed in our Land, I fear are in this particular: when poor creatures are ſo glued to themſelves, or formes, or their own righteouſneſſe and ſelf-riches, that indeed they live upon the ſame; and make a life out of it, and a God upon it: and ſo dwell, as though they were in heaven; when indeed they are neither in the way to it, nor poſſeſſed with it: But if ever God appear either to them or in them, God will unveile them ſo, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed though they have been profeſſors never ſo long, and in the ſame are become rich in their own eyes, and in the eyes of others, yet I beleeve God will burne it up, and bring them to a loſſe; and make their high and lofty ſpirits lye in the duſt; as he hath done with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in their condition.</p>
               <p>I look that the greateſt loſers in our dayes, ſhall be the longeſt and talleſt profeſſors; though in their loſing, it may for the future tend to their greateſt game: yea, <hi>Englands</hi> profeſſors ſhall ere long, cry out of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward loſſes, more then their outward loſſes: and they ſhall be ſtript more naked in matter of ſpirituals, then ever they were of temporals; though in the loſſe of both it may be accompanied with little freedome, but
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:153757:56"/> rather unwillingneſs at preſent, and repinings of ſpirit, though at the laſt they may be delivered from their ſtraits, and be cloathed with the Sun, and then ſhall trample the Moon under their feet; I doe not ſpeak of profeſſors in reference to any particular faction; but I ſpeak of all under what denomination or title ſoever, that are profeſſing God, before they be poſſeſſed with him; who are ſtoring up inward riches, but not of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and Reſt upon it, as though it were of God; which when God makes it manifeſt by the day, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 3. &amp;c.</hi> it burnes and is conſumed, either becauſe it was not of God, or elſe becauſe it was Reſted upon below God: So that now to be brought out of the Creature and all its own ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or ſelfe actings, are ſo contrary to it, and ſo for the annihilating of it; ſo that indeed man in and of himſelfe wil oppoſe God, &amp; ſtand out againſt this work of annihilation: to have a Creature who before was rich in and of himſelfe, or from ſome adminiſtration of God, below the enjoyment of God in the ſame, and according to which, and for the want of which, the Creature makes his habitation below Heaven; though he lives as an Angell, yet as miſerable as any devil, in reference to his want of God in a way of enjoyment; it being thus with a poor heart, that to part with his falſe Reſt is ſo hard and difficult; How then comes the ſoul to ſee them to be falſe, in reference to his Reſting upon them, though they may be true as they are an adminiſtration of God, I ſay, how comes the ſoule to ſee them to be falſe, and ſo either willing to have them either diſſolved, if they be adminiſtrations of God, or burned and conſumed, if they be of the Creature? In anſwer to this, we will ſay both waies in Scripture and experience. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, God makes them known to the Creature, and him willing at laſt, to part with them, by diſcovering
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:153757:56"/> unto him, the emptineſſe of theſe diſpenſations, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is made to ſee the non-ſatisfaction and un-ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof, if continued in by the Creature; as thus, either by diſcovering unto a ſoule, the want of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in it, wherein it appears to be truly empty; or elſe by fruſtrating the Creatures expectation, in the not enjoying that from theſe things but in conceit; which it did expect to finde in them, and receive from them; and herein God hedges up the ſoules wayes with thornes; ſo that now it cannot finde that comfort and refreſhment in thoſe things which formerly it Reſted upon and drew comfort from; now God making them empty and vain to the heart, it is forced to cry out as <hi>Solomon,</hi> of the vanity thereof; and to ſay with them in the 24. of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 16. verſe, <hi>Our leanneſſe, our leanneſſe;</hi> ſo as now he is made willing to ſubmit to the burnings up of his expectation, by ſeeing the vanity of his conceptions in them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By repreſenting to the underſtanding a more excellent Reſt and center for his ſpirit, both ſure and ſafe; this begets a breathing after the enjoyment of that Reſt which it is made to ſee without it, not as yet enjoyed by it (<hi>Iſa. 11. 10. &amp; 13. 16. &amp;</hi> 28. 8.) this ſame makes the ſoule willing to forgoe the one, that he may enjoy the other: For as <hi>Canaan</hi> was diſcovered to the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be more excellent and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious then that place of <hi>Aegypt</hi> was, wherein they were in bondage; which made them at their departure from it, to be willing to part with the Garlick and fleſh-pots: ſo it is with a ſoule in this caſe, the more the glorious Reſt of Chriſt is repreſented to any ſoule, the more it doth diſcover falſe Reſts, and the more it doth unbottome every Creature thereof.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, They are diſcovered too and un-bottomed off theſe Reſts, by the departure of God from any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration; ſo as the ſoule deſires not to Reſt, where
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:153757:57"/> God is departed: for if it hath been thus with the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the cauſe of its Reſt hath been the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of God, in ſuch an adminiſtration or diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet if now he ſee cleerly that God is departed from it, he Reſts no longer; being the ground why he Reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was and is taken away or removed: for as God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to be in, and appear to his People, in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and in the Adminiſtrations under the Law; yet not for everlaſting continuance; but that afterwards he did intend to withdraw his preſence from them, and ſo to diſanull the uſe thereof: ſo in any diſpenſation of God below his ſpirituall appearance in the foul, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to appeare at ſuch a time as himſelfe hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, in the uſe of the ſame; but afterwards to withdraw himſelfe from it, for ſome end beſt known to himſelf.</p>
               <p>Now this is that I ſay, Gods departing and ceaſing to appeare in a Diſpenſation or an Adminiſtration, Is that which both diſcovers the Reſting therein to bee falſe, and is a further meanes to un-bottome the ſpirit of a man for making of it his Reſt any longer: for that Soul that is led into any Adminiſtration by God, in the which God appeares; when God withdraws from it, and ceaſeth to appeare any more in it, the Soule doth the like alſo.</p>
               <p>And in this hee follows the Lambe where ever hee goes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 4. So that I ſay, It is the departure of God from any condition, (which if the creature hath been made ſenſible of it) doth repreſent the making a habitation in it, and the Reſting upon it, is both below God, and contrary to him; ſo as in the ſame hee is made willing to part with, and to ſee when God is known to be departed from, the vanity of making any thing his Reſt though given of God, untill God do everlaſtingly appear within man, carrying up the ſoule and ſpirit of man into himſelf.</p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:153757:57"/>
               <p>Fourthly, The next way God diſcovers theſe to bee falſe Reſts, and makes the creature willing to part with the ſame, Is by appearing in a more gloryous Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration to the Creature; and this is the reaſon why Chriſt comforteth his Diſciples, when the form of the fleſh was to be taken away, by telling of them <hi>He muſt go away, or elſe the Comforter would not come, Joh.</hi> 16. 7. As if he ſhould ſay, unleſſe I depart in the forme of fleſh, or in this outward Diſpenſation, you cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy mee in a more gloriou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Diſpenſation of the <hi>Spirit</hi> within you; which ſhould for ever abide with you: It is the Subſtance of what God intends to make manifeſt in your ſpirits.</p>
               <p>I am but in this fleſhly diſpenſation a figure, and therefore I muſt depart, that I may more gloriouſly appeare within you; and lead you into all Truth, more glorious then yet you ſee or underſtand. It was ſo with John and Chriſt in the fleſh; as John did decreaſe, ſo Chriſt did encreaſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 30. It was indeed the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing of Chriſt in the fleſhly Adminiſtration, that made John in his Adminiſtration decreaſe: for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of God in the fleſh of Chriſt, was more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious then the diſpenſation of John; ſo that in ſpirituals there is a giving way to a ſuperiour or more glorious Adminiſtration, by an inſeriour or leſſe glorious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation: for the more of God appeares in any forme, the more glorious is that forme: now God did more appeare in Chriſts forme then in Johns; which made John decreaſe and give way unto the diſpenſation of Chriſt: from whence I obſerve, That no man is to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake any diſpenſation, ſo long as God appeares in it, and makes it a living diſpenſation: for the Apoſtles were not to ceaſe walking with, or to depart from Chriſt in the fleſh, un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>il God was departed from it; and ceaſed according to it or by it: but all the Apoſtles were to continue in that diſpenſation, ſo long as it was a living diſpenſation.</p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:153757:58"/>
               <p>So it was with the diſpenſations under the Law; they were to continue in them ſo long as God appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them and continued with them: So ſhall ſoules follow as God leades; As the Children of Iſrael were to abide in any place, ſo long as God abode in it: So we; And as they did move, when God moved from it, ſo are we until we are in our perfect Reſt, <hi>Num. 9. 17. 18. Heb.</hi> 4. 9. For it is the preſence of God in a particular thing, which is both to be a ſoules Leader, <hi>Exo.</hi> 34. 14, 15. and his cauſe of ſtay in the uſe of any diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: So it was with <hi>Moſes,</hi> Unleſſe thy preſence goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with us, carry us not hence.</p>
               <p>It hath been, and ſtil ought to be, That Saints re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving out of one condition into another, or from one Adminiſtration or Diſpenſation into another, hath been by the preſence of God, either going, or remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from ſuch a Diſpenſation: So that there may be a folly in this particular; for any man to ceaſe acting in formes, or in ſuch an Adminiſtration as God hath brought him into, and truly appeared in, untill there bee a cleare departure of GOD in the ſame, leading it into a more glorious Adminiſtration.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God ſeldome doth depart from one Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, until he appeares in a more glorious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in another: As God did not depart from the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Law, until he appeared more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the Adminiſtration of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>So it is now, That there can be no expelling clouds but by Light, ſo there can be no other way to take off a ſoule truly from the uſe of any ſorme, until God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in a more higher diſpenſation. For as the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Chriſt in the fleſh was the ſumme and ſubſtance of the forms of the Law, and was not to bee diſanul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led before the ſubſtance came, <hi>Heb. 8. 1. Col.</hi> 2. 17. ſo it is now: The ſumme and ſubſtance of all Formes and Adminiſtrations, is Chriſt in the <hi>Spirit;</hi> and untill
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:153757:58"/> the Subſtance of them be come perfectly into every heart, there can be no true ceſſation of that heart in Formes or Adminiſtrations, which are Goſpel Formes or Adminiſtrations.</p>
               <p>So that God departing ſometimes from an Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, and appearing more glorious in another, either within or without; is that which both unbottoms the ſoul of Reſting in it, and that which makes the creature willing to part with it. For the want of this the Jewes not beholding Chriſt, the ſumme and ſubſtance of the Law, Come in a more glorious Adminiſtration, they were unwilling to ceaſe acting in their former Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations; the Veile being not taken away, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 14. whereby they had been made to ſee the Subſtance of thoſe Formes, eſtabliſht compleatly in a Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 10.</p>
               <p>But laſtly, The chiefeſt and onlyeſt way why the creature comes to bee willing to be moſt free to part with, and to have a diſcovery of all diſpenſations below the appearance of God in the Spirit to bee no Reſt, Is by the glorious manifeſtation of God in the Soule; whereby,</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, He appeares as a glorious Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in man. And this Light,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Expels all the Clouds from off, or out of the Creature; which kept the Creature from beholding a reall difference betwixt a true Reſt and a falſe: So long as man is without this, no marvel then, though he be not able to diſcerne whether his Reſts be true or falſe: But now when God ſpeaks in a Soule, <hi>Ariſe,</hi> ſoul, <hi>ſhine, for thy light is come, and the glory of the LORD is Riſen upon thee, Iſa.</hi> 60. 1, 2. Then this true Light ſhining into the Soule, it makes manifeſt all things; whereas the Soule before had a Veile upon him, and a Cloud over him; but now the glory of God is Riſen in ſuch a creatures heart, whereby hee is made able
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:153757:59"/> to judge by the light of God dwelling in him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As it doth diſcover what is fallacy; ſo it reveals what is truth: it advanceth Truth in the ſoule, though the ſoule before was ignorant, what difference there was betwixt the appearance of God in formes without him, and the appearance of God in the <hi>Spirit</hi> within him: of the difference betwixt a transform'd reſt reſembled, and a true Reſt in the Spirit manifeſted: of the end of all formes and adminiſtations, with God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in them, without the creature, before the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the ſame be come in the glory of the <hi>Spirit</hi> within. Now this true Light makes all manifeſt (<hi>John</hi> 3. 21.) and is a clear evidencing light within man; diſcovering Him who only muſt be the center and Reſt of the ſoule; which before it heard of, but now comes to ſee and experience the ſame. This Light removes all obſtructions out of the Creature; and makes his judgement act according to this Light within him; ſo that it is a Light not onely expelling clouds; but clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonſtrates a reall difference betwixt Truth and Falſhood; ſo as now he is made to ſee, the place God hath ſet every adminiſtration or diſpenſation in, with the time, place and end.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This Light makes not onely manifeſt <hi>things as they are, John</hi> 3. 21. and ſo takes the ſoule off from them: But it doth diſſolve all thoſe adminiſtrations the Creature hath had without him, by the glory of God in the <hi>Spirit</hi> within him: ſo as the breakings of the day doth diſſolve the diſpenſation of the night; ſo doth the dawning of the day in the heart of a Saint, diſſolve, not deſtroy, any of thoſe adminiſtrations or diſpenſations of God, in which God did in ſome meaſure appear to the Creature: for as the night is of God as well as the day; yet the day doth diſſolve the diſpenſation of the night: So though many mens diſpenſations were of God; yet notwithſtanding when God appears, they
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:153757:59"/> are diſſolved and doe not now appear; becauſe a more gloriouſer manifeſtation of God within man hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Yea, this manifeſtation of God in the <hi>Spirit</hi> doth ſwallow up all other diſpenſations; ſo as now they are gathered up into the ſubſtance thereof, who before did ſend them forth; as the light of the Starres and the light of the Moone, are bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed lights, or lights inferiour to, and ſent out from the Sunne; and when the glory of the Sunne appeares, they all appeare bodily and ſubſtantially in the Sunne: and as it is that the light dwels in the fulneſſe of it in the Sunne, and all lights are borrowed from or occaſioned by it; and that light is that which ſwallowes up all other, when it comes to appear; So it is with God appearing in the <hi>Spirit;</hi> he appeares as the fulneſſe and the ſubſtance, or body of all other lights, (<hi>Col.</hi> 2. 17.) which are true, though ſent by God, in their diſpenſation, to accompliſh his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne: yet when God breakes into all ſoules in the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Spirit, this ſhining of God into the ſoule (2 <hi>Cor. 3. 8. &amp; 4. 6. &amp;</hi> 3. 10.) doth ſwallow up all his former appearances in any diſpenſation below this; and gives way and ſubmits, and ſo gathers up and meets compleatly in the body and ſubſtance of them (<hi>Col. 2. 10. 17. Tit. 2. 13. 1 Pet.</hi> 4. 14.) which is God truly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in the Spirit of fulneſſe and glory, this makes the heart free to part with any thing, though never ſo dear to it, which is obſtructive to, and keeps the ſoule from any enjoyment of this glorious diſpenſation; yea, this is that diſpenſation, which doth deſtroy all admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations, or formes, or diſpenſations that are not of God; what is of God before, ſhall be ſwallowed up in it; what is of man, ſelfe or Satan ſhall be deſtroyed by it: 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 8.) This is that which truly diſcovers to the ſoule all his falſe Reſts, though never ſo ſeemingly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious;
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:153757:60"/> yea, though they be of Satans transformings, or of ſelfs reſemblings; yet it laies them all in the duſt, and unvailes them to the Creature; ſo as they appeare in their colours and place; which ſometimes workes a mighty indignation in the heart, againſt the waies of his own heart (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 11.) when his lewdneſſe is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unto him, ſo as he is not onely made free to part with the ſame: but he is brought out of love with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, for Reſting upon the ſame, ſo much below God or Chriſt. Again, in the manifeſtation of God, there is ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; Peace and Reſt poſſeſſeth the Creature in ſtead of the other; this peace diſpoſſeſſeth the other peace; this ſatisfaction maketh nothing the other; whatſoever objection or diſ-ſatisfaction was before, or doth ariſe ſince, now they are all fully anſwered, and the ſoule compleatly ſatisfied; ſo as now he is brought out of a dunghill, into a pallace; from a mean condition into a glorious, to wit, even to live by the breathings of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Truth in him; ſo as now he lives, becauſe God lives and is ſatisfied with the flowings in of God, and eates of that which God eates of, <hi>viz.</hi> Love, Glory, and happineſſe. Nay further there is fulneſſe in this ſatisfaction; he fils the ſoule with himſelfe, and how can then this ſoule doe any other, but be free and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to part with any other ſeeming fulneſſe or good, when now he is filled with him that fils all in all, in all things. <hi>Eph. 1. 23. So as the waters cover the Sea,</hi> Iſa. 11. 9. ſo is the ſoul truly (<hi>pro tempore</hi>) filled with God untill he aſſwage it, or ſeem to be departed from it; or elſe enlarge the capacity of the Creature with more of himſelfe: now ſeeing that God comes in with ſuch a fulneſſe into the heart in this diſpenſation; it muſt needs diſcover the emptineſſe and vanity of his other Reſts, and cauſe a ſweet willingneſſe to part with the one, and embrace the other.</p>
               <p>And laſtly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It comes in power: which day of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:153757:60"/> Gods power (<hi>Pſ.</hi> 110. 3.) makes the Creature willing to part with any darling, though never ſo dear and neer to him, both freely, cordially, and with much ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of ſpirit; whatſoever the day of God in its light and glory doth diſcover to the ſoule not to be of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, this the day of his Power doth accompliſh the ſame to the full in the ſoule; yea, though it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Chriſt made manifeſt in a heart, and his ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all coming into the ſame, is like unto a fire which burns up &amp; conſumes al things that are in the ſoul of his own, which keep the Creature below God; therfore ſaith the Scripture, <hi>Who may abide the day of his coming, or ſtand when he appeareth?</hi> And he ſhews the reaſon therof, <hi>for he is like a refiners fire, and like fullers ſope:</hi> to refiners fire he is compared: the appearance of Chriſt in the love of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> is like refiners fire, to refine &amp; puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, yea, to burn up and conſume in ſoules, what is not of the Spirit, and ſo to bring the creature to a loſſe, though in the fame ſalvation ſhall be made manifeſt, as according to the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 13, 14. where ſaith he, if any mans work abide, which he hath built thereupon, he ſhall receive a reward: but if it burn, the creature ſhall loſe thereby, yet he muſt be ſaved, yet it muſt be by this fire, which did conſume and burn up his hay and ſtubble: now as mans work ſhall be revealed by fire; ſo if it be not of God it ſhall be deſtroyed by the ſame: which fire is love, which is God: &amp; thus when he brings a ſoul, by his appearing, into the greateſt loſſe, then is he bringing a ſoule into the greateſt gain: ſo that that which proves deſtruction of his falſe Reſts; is that which brings him to the true Reſt; and ſo though it be a loſing for the preſent, yet his greateſt loſſe becomes his greateſt gain</p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:153757:61"/>
               <p>Now I know there is many Reſts that are deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or diſſolved, before this day of his coming; and as there is one taken away, the ſoule findes and ſeeks after another; and runs from mountain to hill, to get eaſe of a tormenting <hi>ſpirit;</hi> ſo as man paſſeth through many Reſts, moſt commonly before this day: but now it may be the Creature hath ſuch glorious reſembled Reſts, that it can not be found out before the day of Gods thus appearing, then theſe ſeeming Reſts are they which are diſcovered, upon the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of himſelfe in the ſoule: But ſome ſoules paſſe through more then we have ſpoken of; ſome through fewer; according as God keeps the ſoule, and alone becomes the leader of him: yet many ſoules that are come thus high, have found them by ſad experience, and others have found ſome of them, and others more; yet it is ſometimes Gods way to permit the Creature to run out after the waies of his own heart; and at laſt to hed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Having ſhewed the many Reſts Soules paſſe thorow and the difficulty of parting with them; together with the waies and means God wakes the heart willing; that now he may enjoy that true and unchangeable Reſt of ſoules; which ſhall be the next wee ſhall ſpeak of; and that is, What this true Reſt is; which the ſpirits of a ſpirituall man muſt be centred.</p>

               <p>Firſt, Chriſt it is cleare, he lives out of the Creature: for he lay in the heart of God (<hi>John</hi> 1. 18.) before we had a being, and is diſcovered and revealed by God within us, when we have a being, which was purpoſed by God to be revealed from God; and therein to be a center and Reſt to that heart who doth enjoy it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It cannot be attained by the Creature; his abilities falling ſhort of the doing of any ſuch worke: but he was the purpoſe of Love, freely intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God before time; and as freely without the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture comes to be made manifeſt by God in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in time: For it is nothing which the Creature of himſelfe can attain; which as a ſure Reſt in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will remaine; but it will faile the ſoule and prove a broken Reed.</p>

               <head>The ſecond deſcription of true Reſt.</head>
               <p>SEcondly, It is an unchangeable and unalterable Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſeen by the ſoule after it is revealed to him, which cannot be ſhaken after the Creature is centred in it; wherein the Creaure is carried out of himſelfe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove himſelfe, to Reſt ſecurely above all feares.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Chriſt the eternall Being of Spirits, God in God, only God, he it is that is an unchangeable Being, (<hi>Iſa. 9. 6. Heb. 13. 8. Mal.</hi> 3. 6.) which alters not, neither is given to change; for he was yeſterday, that is before time; he is to day, that is in time; the ſame he is for ever, that is unto all time: <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 8. Now if we looke upon Chriſt as Saints Reſt, wee muſt not conſider him as he was in any forme or ſhape, for ſo
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:153757:62"/> he altered and changed into divers formes and ſhapes: But we are to conſider him as he is God, Eternal, Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: yea, as he is the power of all powers; and ſo he is the foundation and Reſt of Saints: For as he was in the fleſh, he was not to be a Reſt, but as he was in the Spirit, ſo he is Reſt, both unchangeable and unalterable, <hi>In whom there is no variableneſſe, neither ſhadow of turning, James</hi> 1. 17. So that now Saints knowledge of him, and their Reſt in him, is ſure and abides: And this is that which heightens their aſſurance, to ſee and know that the Reſt of their ſouls is an unalterable Reſt: that though diſpenſations change, and hee in thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, yet the Center of his ſoul abides for ever, and he kept unſhaken in it; becauſe he Reſts and Lives in and upon an unſhaken, unchangeable Center.</p>
               <p>Now ſhall the diſquieted and moleſted ſoul live in peace, ſafety, and quietneſſe, and none now can make it in this caſe afraid; but it lives above all feares and torments; being kept ſafe in this Divine Spirit and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, where there is neither cauſe of jealouſie or feare; but being they are removed, and the creature firmly eſtabliſht, ſo that all ſtormes do not moleſt him, and all temptations do not un-reſt him; but he lives Triumphant above them, Triumphing upon them, by that power in which he is Centred.</p>

               <head>The Third Deſcription of true Reſt.</head>
               <p>THirdly, It is an unexpreſſible glorious Center or Being, wholly taking up the Creature with it, and giving the ſoul full contentment in it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is an unexpreſſible glorious Center; the Lord promiſing in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> that hee would accompliſh a glorious worke, in ſilling the hearts of his People with

Yea, the Reſt of Saints is the very Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his glory; which glory is Chriſt, when hee comes to bee manifeſted in his Saints, and to bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired by them, 2: <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 1. 9, 10.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It wholly takes up the Creature who is Centred in it; ſo as now the ſoul or ſpirit is wholly ſwallowed up of God; and unexpreſſibly overcome is ſuch a ſoul: The glory of God, which is Chriſt, is that which ſwallows up mens ſpirits; and the more it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in them, the more it overcomes them: ſo as now they are taken up in their ſpirits, being gathered up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, with nothing elſe but it: So as now the ſoules delight, ioy, ſolace, is now alone in nothing but in him, who is become a glorious Center to him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Reſt of Saints gives Saints full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment: the full ſatisfaction of Saints lyes in living and Reſting compleatly in this glory, which truly is Chriſt; ſo as man ſometimes is loſt in the greatneſſe of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The leaſt manifeſtation of this glory, doth fill the creatures capacity; ſo that until the capacity be enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with more of God, it can deſire no farther enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or diſcovery of it: ſo as now his ſpirit is filled with glory.

               <p>Secondly, It would be no place for Saints to delight and ſolace themſelves in, unleſſe they could bee wholly taken up, and ſeallowed up with that which of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty muſt be enjoyed from it; and unleſſe it did exceed all glory that could bee imagined, it could be no Reſt for the ſpirit of a ſpirituall man: So that it muſt be an unexpreſſible glory ſwallowing up of mens ſpirits with it; and giving that ſpirit compleat ſatisfaction and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in it.</p>

               <head>The fourth deſcription of true Reſt.</head>
               <p>IN the fourth place, This Reſt is a carrying forth of the Creature, out of the creature, into the place where he had his firſt Being, to live for ever in him, who is now become his manifeſted Being.</p>
               <p>Firſt, before wee ſpeak of the Reſt it ſelf we will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</p>
               <p>That there is no true Reſt for the creature in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; for if man either Reſt in his pure naturals, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any refined property in himſelf, he Reſts out of his proper Element: I mean, as he is a ſpirituall man: yea, It is both unſafe and unſound ſo to doe: neither can man with any ſolid delight, or true contentment, Reſt in or upon any, eyther pure naturals, or refined proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or parts within himſelfe, though man could attaine to his firſt principles and purity, yet if he Reſted upon them, he would live below the true Center of Spirits: for indeed the Reſt and proper being of all ſpirits, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially thoſe that are renewed, is the Eternall Word of God: which Word is Chriſt, who made all things in
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:153757:63"/> the World of nothing, into which nothing they are to returne: But the ſpirits of men, or eſpecially that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed ſpirit of Saints, that came down from the Father of ſpirits, who begot this ſpirit in them, not by fleſh, but by himſelfe in his ſpirituall breathings and actings in the Creature; which ſpirit of man cannot live in any true element, neither can it live ſatisfied, untill it come into its proper and originall Being, from whence it came: for every thing is in its right place, when it is returned into its originall, and place from whence it was derived; ſo that the ſpirit returnes to God that gave it <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12. 7. and the fleſh of the man into the duſt from whence it was derived: ſo that man as he is carnall and fleſh, it cannot be poſſible that the ſpirit of any ſhould take much delight in the ſame, ſo as to make it the ſatisfying Center: But yet after it is renewed, it may be compared to <hi>Noahs</hi> Dove, it ſees the Deluge, and looks abroad in the fleſh; to the Mountain of former ſelf-actings, and pure naturals, yet it cannot reſt in the ſame, neither can it take any delight therein; but is made to returne to the Arke Jeſus Chriſt; who though he is in the ſoule, yet above it; as the Arke above the water, ſo Chriſt above the Creature, though within it, as the Deluge in the world: ſo that the Creature as man, is no fit place for a renewed ſpirit to be centred up in; but he muſt by divine power be brought out of himſelfe, into that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall being of ſpirits, who is ſaid to be above man, though in man, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 6. as the Arke above the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, though in the world.</p>
               <p>Now man cannot truly Reſt in himſelfe. But</p>
               <p>Secondly, The place into which the ſoule is carried, is and was the firſt being of his ſpirits, and now mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted ſo to be to the Creature; which being was Chriſt: this Chriſt was Gods eternall thoughts of Love, in which man had a being, and now comes in time as a
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:153757:64"/> Being to be manifeſted in the Saints; ſo the one was the unknown Being of Saints before time, where they lay in the Love and heart of God, which nothing could remove them out of it: the other Reſt, is the known Reſt and being of Saints made manifeſt unto them in time; which knowledge begets a returning of ſpirit, who with much wea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ineſſe of ſpirit have been waiting for ſuch a day of Redemption (<hi>Luke</hi> 21. 28.) that it might return into its firſt originall and being, and to be fully ſecured in its God, which before it neither knew nor did experience: So that after the heart hath a diſcovery of this Being, it is like a Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone touching the Needle; the Needle can ſtand no way but towards the North and South; ſo with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of man, after it is touched with his Being, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter manifeſted, it is not able to Reſt in all the glories or excellencies that can poſſibly be imagined, untill it be returned into its being: he is like a wicked man or man of this world, who cannot act but in his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement: and like a Fiſh whoſe element is in the water: ſo with the ſpirit of man, he cannot act in his right ſphere, untill he come into his firſt originall Being, which is Chriſt in God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. ſo as now it acts in God, and lives by God, and is taken up with God: and cannot live in any thing elſe, not as a Saint.</p>
               <p>So that the trueſt compariſon that can be made of ſuch a ſpirit, is the Needle, and the Dove, which truly holds out this to us.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That Chriſt, the Arke is the center, and the ſure being of the ſpirits of Saints.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is no ſafety or true Reſt for the beleeving ſpirit, but in this Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That it is impoſſible for any ſpirit who knowes Chriſt truly to be his Reſt; being once touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the divine and holy being of Saints, to Reſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſame; though many things may transform-them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:153757:64"/> ſelves within the Creature like unto it, yet upon them he cannot Reſt, no more then can the Needle towards the Eaſt and Weſt; but it is truly known by ſuch a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit not to be his firſt being and originall; and ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims it, as Chriſt did Satan in his temptation: but is carried forth the more in vehemency of ſpirit, fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing continually without Reſt, untill he be got into the Arke, which was the place from whence it came; and in truth it is of ſuch a latitude, as all the world is not able either to give Reſt unto it, or produce true or full contentment in it.</p>

               <head>The fifth decription of true Reſt.</head>
               <p>FIftly, It is the centring up of a ſpirituall man in a ſpirituall place, not made, nor created, but a being of himſelfe, ſtands by himſelfe, having his dependency upon none elſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Here is the ſubject matter of Reſt, and that is the ſpirituall part of man, which is created again and born of the <hi>Spirit; John</hi> 3. 3. for firſt of all no uncleane ſpirit or thing ſhall come there; <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 27. nothing ſhal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into it, but that which is become ſutable to it: That which is borne of the Spirit is, that which muſt enter into this Kingdome of Reſt and peace.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This ſpirituallity which is made in the Creature, is produced by God poſſeſſed in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for as a carnall heart cannot live in God; no more can God manifeſt himſelfe in any unpure ſpirit; ſo as God before he manifeſt himſelfe to a Spirit, he makes it ſutable to that glory, which ſhall i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:153757:65"/> worke of the New Birth in him; ſo that if man were carried up into God (which is impoſſible before he be borne of God, there is ſuch a diſproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the purity and holineſſe of God, and the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and carnalneſſe of mens ſpirits, that the Reſt of the ſoul o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ld be no Reſt; for there would be nothing but war and enmity: ſo that God alwayes puls downe mountaines of fleſh, pride, and ſelfe; and makes the crooked waies of the heart plaine, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3. 5, 6. and brings downe thoſe falſe Reſts and Chriſts in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and ſo after makes known a glorious Center to the creature.</p>
               <p>Now the ſpirits being made ſpirituall, by being Borne againe, it is made ſpiritually to judge, receive, and diſcerne the Truth of this glorious and ſpirituall Place, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 15. which no man in the fleſh, or by the fleſh can attain to, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 16. whom never any man in the carnall minde hath ſeen, nor can ſee: So that mans Reſting place, together with the ſubject Reſting in it, muſt be ſpirituall and of himſelf.</p>
               <p>Now ſecondly, This place of Reſt is Spirituall, ſo that man if hee bee in any true Reſt, It is not carnall formes or ordinances, which ſhall ceaſe: Neither is it the rareſt Qualifications, or expreſſions of creatures; neither is it glorious apprehenſions or puffings up of fleſh; no, our Reſt is beyond theſe, as far as the light of the Sun is from the Candle: Hee is an unexpreſſible Spirituall Being, One who makes all things ſpirituall, that are ſpirituall, by that ſpirituallity in the fulneſſe of it that dwels in him: He is the expreſſe Image of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. yea, he is God equall in Nature, though inferiour in place, operation or expreſſion: He is One in all things; He is above all things, and in him all things conſiſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 17. So he being the Fulneſſe and the Cauſe of ſpirituallity, He himſelfe muſt needs be ſpiritual. So that any ſoul Centred up in him, lives
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:153757:65"/> above all carnall Formes, Ordinances, Qualifications, common holineſſe or fleſhly puffings up, eyther in falſe apprehenſions, or in inward deluſions; Hee is none of theſe, but is above theſe, which is the ſpirituall mans Reſt: And this ſpirituall Reſt is nothing but God, who is all and none beſides him; who enjoyes all in himſelf, and we in him; and by virtue of our being made, born, and begotten of him; we become One with him, and of him: So that now being borne of him, it is impoſſible that the Nature of God in us, can Reſt or bee ſatisfied but alone in him and by him, it being of an everlaſting and infinite nature: but now as it is infinite, and of God in us, ſo it throws off all below God, and wholly and alone returnes to him and Reſts in him.</p>
               <p>Now thirdly, This Reſt is not any thing Created, or depending upon any other power but its own. Chriſt as he was in the fleſh, is none of the Reſt of Saints: Hee is a Reſt of them, as he becomes one with them in the Spirit; ſo as he is one with God, and we with him; One in God, and we in him, 1. <hi>Cor. 6. 17. Joh.</hi> 17. 21, 22, 23. Yea, very God, and we by him, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 6. 15. 45. So that He is a Spirit not made nor created, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and creating all things for and of himſelfe, <hi>Col. 1. 16. Rom.</hi> 11. 36. And all by him was created, not as he was in any form or ſhape in the fleſh without us, not ſo to be a Reſt; but as he is God made manifeſt in the Spirit within us: How ever men deem of him, yet he is the Eternall Spirit, and the Father of all ſpirits, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. though diſtinguiſhed from the Father in divers acts, ſhapes or formes, yet he dwels ſubſtantially in the God-head, and in whom dwels all the power and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof, <hi>Col</hi> 1. 19. 2. 9. And though he might be in the forme of fleſh as man, yet then he was in the power and fulneſſe of God as God: So that he is In, and Of Himſelf; and he that knows him aright, knows that ſaying.</p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:153757:66"/>
               <p>And he that is experienced in that ſpirituall union and conjunction, will ſay, That his Motion, Glory, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency, and all others that can be ſpoke of, dwels ſubſtantially in him; and that by him now all things are both preſerved and kept, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. So as all other Reſts below this, are none at all; but only for them that know not this ſame Eternall Being.</p>
               <p>But now this Chriſt, Hee being ſuch a Myſtery, and there being in the Earth ſuch diſſention about him, To give true Definitions of him, I will in the next place ſet forth what this Chriſt is, who is the Reſt of Saints. We have in ſhort ſet forth Chriſt the Eternall Spirit, to be the Reſt of Saints: not as conſidered in any forme of fleſh, but as conſidered in the fulneſſe of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>But what Chriſt is, in the fulneſſe of the Spirit, that is the thing wee are to explaine and clearly to diſtinguiſh.</p>

For the word that was ſpoken at firſt, which word was <hi>from the beginning,</hi> 1 John 1. 1. which word was ſpoken without and in time, becauſe the ſame fleſh with us, was but figures of the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of that internall Word, which God will ſpeake with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in every Creature, which Word ſhall become Chriſt within man, after it is ſpoken unto man; which Chriſt is a myſtery to every one who knowes him not in this ſenſe: but to prove this more fuller in the 9. Chapter of the <hi>Rev.</hi> ver. 13. There he is in expreſſe tearmes called, <hi>The Word of God;</hi> which expreſſion I looke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to have ſpeciall reference to this particular wee are ſpeaking of, <hi>viz.</hi> The being the eternall or internall Voice of God within every Creature: and indeed he is made manifeſt in every voice of God in ſoules: and this Word in Scripture is often called the voice of Chriſt; that is the Voice of God, which in name and nature is Chriſt: <hi>John 5 25. 28. John 10. 3, 4. John</hi> 14. 11. For to looke upon Jeſus Chriſt as he is in the Father, and ſo a Spirit, wee are to looke upon it, that all Voyces that are ſpoken from the Spirit within us, are voyces of God, which for diſtinction ſake is tearmed Chriſt: for as he was in fleſh, he was not this internall Word; for the externall Word of God, became a Chriſt in the fleſh; <hi>John</hi> 1. 14 ſo doth the internall Word of God
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:153757:67"/> within us, become a ſaving Jeſus to us; the one without us, before our time in the figure, which was to paſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and not to continue in that forme and ſhape for ever to us; and ſo not to be Reſted upon; but the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Word of God within us, is a diſpenſation of God which cannot be taken away or deſtroyed, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides for ever; ſo as in the 1 <hi>John 2. 14. I have written unto you young men, becauſe ye are ſtrong;</hi> which ſtrength was the abiding of this Word within them; which Word was Chriſt, which they from God had ſpoke within them. Now this Internall, externall Word of the Spirit of Chriſt, this Word is faithfull and true; <hi>Rev</hi> 19. 11. 13. yea, unchangeable; upon which the Saints Spirits doe Reſt and live.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Chriſt is a cleare manifeſtation of God within us: He was the manifeſtation of God when he was in the figure, which was in the fleſh, there God was manifeſted in a myſtery; which myſtery was Chriſt: now as Chriſt without us was God manifeſted in the fleſh; ſo Chriſt within us, is God manifeſted in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: This Chriſt within man, cannot be revealed in any fleſhly forme, but he muſt be revealed as he is in the Spirit, one with the Father; yea in the Father: So that when God clearely reveales himſelf in any ſoul, this which is now revealed is nothing elſe but himſelf in Love handed out by this Revelation Chriſt; ſo that in Scriptures He is called the viſion of God. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p>Again, wee ſee it plainly declared in the 1. <hi>Joh. 1. 1. 2.

So as indeed they thought he was come to ſet up a Kingdome in the fleſh, and that hee would advance them in ſome great place: as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares.</p>
               <p>So that is was Gods great deſigne which was held forth in that forme of fleſh, which is the ſum of that Scripture, where he is declared to be the light of the Gentiles, and to be the Glory of the people <hi>Iſrael, Luk.</hi> 2. 32. Now to prove it by Scripture, that this Chriſt is in the ſpirituall coming and advancing in the ſoule a glorious and Divine Light.</p>
               <p>Wee ſee it very clear from that Scripture, in the 60. of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1, 2. Where the Lord declares the manner of Chriſts ſpirituall appearing in the ſoule: <hi>Ariſe, ſhine, for thy Light is come, and the glory of the LORD is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen upon thee.</hi> This ſame Scripture, though men doe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to deny it to be meant of Chriſts appearance in any particular ſoule, yet he that hath found the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Chriſt within him, hath found him fully making good theſe ſayings.

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:153757:69"/> and Glory; which light is God, appearing in a diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of light and glory, the which diſpenſation is Chriſt in us, for he is both the light and glory of God, and all things that are either ſpirituall, light or glory diſcovered is Chriſt; for according to that Scripture, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 23. The glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof. As if he ſhould ſay, when the Lord comes to dwell ſpiritually, in the manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of glory within the ſpirits of man, and ſo ſet up a Temple in the creature, according to the 22th verſe. Then ſhall all thoſe lights, which before the ſoule hath beene guided by, whether they were flaſhes or reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled light, now there ſhall be no need of the ſame, but the glory of God now ſhall be there to enlighten the ſame: yea, Chriſt ſhall be the light thereof, ſo that he ſhall be filled with true light; whoever hath the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious appearance of Chriſt within him, he ſhall become a compleat light unto that ſoule: So as he ſhall not ſtand in need of any inferiour light, but they ſhall bee diſſolved, when the glory of the Sun doth appeare; ſo that in ſuch a ſoule to whom Chriſt is become in this manner a light unto, he ſhall have no night there; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that in the 22. of <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. verſe. But the Lord ſhall fill ſuch a ſoule with light, yea, he ſhall give to ſuch ſpirits Him, in whom there is no darkneſſe, as in a ſpirituall diſpenſation, and as he is termed in <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 9. verſe.

And truly he, within ſoules, workes like God, and there is no knowne di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction betwixt his transformings, and Chriſts work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, untill there be a true transfiguring of Chriſt in the glory of the Spirit; and this doth finde out all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite both of heart and Satan: for indeed there is no forme, though never ſo glorious, but he will transforme himſelfe in it; there is no working of the ſpirit within man, but he will reſemble it; ſo that none ſhall be able to know, whether it be true or falſe, within him or without him, untill this Chriſt ſhall appear in light and glory, and ſhall make the ſame manifeſt; ſo as often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times his thus appearing is compared to the riſing of the Sun, and the dawning of the day, which are degrees of diſtinguiſhing light, which doth diſſolve the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect light of the Moone and Starres, and is a clear light of it ſelfe, to rule and order, to unfold and diſcover the truth of every thing, which under the other diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions could not be diſcerned, and that is the reaſon that the Apoſtle tels them, that they have a ſure word of propheſy, whereunto they doe well if they take heed: And he tels them how long it was, untill the day dawne, and the day-ſtarre ariſe in their hearts. This ſaying (untill) preſcribes and ſets out the limitation of time, and the accompliſhing of the ſame, as if he ſhould ſay, there is a moſt glorious day to be enjoyed in Saints, which day ſhall appeare; but for your directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on untill that day, you have a ſure word of propheſy,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:153757:70"/> unto which if God give you care thereof, may be as a rule unto you. It being a light ſhining in a dark place, and though for the preſent you walke by the ſame, yet Reſt not there, but waite for the ſpirituall coming of Chriſt within you, which in this word of propheſy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is held forth to you; and then when he comes, he ſhall be a perfect light within, which light ſhall ſpeak truth, and leade the ſoule thereunto: but in the interim, Looke to that ſure word of propheſy, which declares and makes manifeſt the truth thereof. This word of Propheſy was the Scriptures; this day dawning, and day-ſtarre ariſing, was the appearance of Chriſt in the fulneſſe of the ſpirit within them. So as he often in Scripture is called, the bright Morning Starre: and as concerning his ſpirituall coming, he is ſometimes term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the notion of the day dawning, or breaking; as in <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 17. and in many others; onely to ſhew unto us, that the breaking in of Chriſt into a heart, is like the breaking of the light into the earth, when the day begins to appeare, and the night is expired; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the riſing of the Sun; to that purpoſe he is often called the Sun of Righteouſneſſe, which ſhall ariſe and be ſeene in the hearts of men, ſo that wee ſee this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt: yea, himſelfe is a true and glorious light of God in the ſpirits of Saints, ſo as he makes all things manifeſt to ſuch a heart, whether true or falſe; and this light ſhall cloath every Saints ſpirit, and all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour and transformed lights ſhall be under ſuch a ſoules feet, triumphing over them, ſeeing the fallacy of them.</p>
               <p>Then Firſt, it is this light Chriſt, within the creature, who appeares as light, which doth expell or diſpell all thoſe Clouds which are with creatures, in whom he hath not appeared: for as the Sun doth expell the Clouds in the appearance thereof, ſo Chriſt in his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſhinings forth and breaking in into every belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

               <p>Secondly, By this light Chriſt doth diſcover all the falſe Waies and Reſts of the creature, either in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to, or being below the true and ſubſtantiall way of Reſt: ſo that this light Chriſt, in his divine Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances within the creature, doth bring a day of loſſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many ſpirits; when it diſcovers unto them the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of their ſpirits, in running after the wayes of their owne hearts; and here they come to ſee the empty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of formes, or former flaſhes; and now, it may be, all the ſoules knowledge and practiſe muſt lye in the duſt, and be unlearned: ſo as this light brings the creature out of love with his owne Wayes; ſo that now he is free to be led according to the teachings of this light.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This light, Chriſt, in its ſpirituall appearing in the creature, doth reveale and diſcover the Father in this light, Chriſt; ſo as the heart clearly ſees and knows the Father and the Spirit, the Son and the Spirit One, and the Spirit to be both: ſo as this light, which in reference to name, is called and tearmed Chriſt, yet it is God in this light, ſo that God is ſaid to be light, and in him is no darkneſſe: The Father is the fountaine of light, the Son is the manifeſtation of light, or the light made manifeſt: now here the ſoule in whom this true light doth appeare, doth know God, and him thus ſent into the heart by Jeſus Chriſt: So that Chriſt as he is the Reſt of Saints, is a divine revelation of light, in which light and glory, the creatures ſpirit ſolaces it ſelfe, and reſts with much delight in the ſame; and our of this form, after enjoyed, will not Chriſt appeare, but will be unto ſuch a ſpirit an everlaſting light: that now as God lives in light, ſo the creature lives in light alſo,

               <p>Fourthly, in the fourth place this Spirituall Chriſt, or what he is in the Spirit, when he comes to be the Reſt of Saints. He is ſpirituall and divine Life, without which no ſoul hath ſpirituall or eternall life injoyed by him: for as a man without the ſoul is dead, ſo are all men, without Ieſus Chriſt within them, made manifeſt: ſo that <hi>John</hi> very fully layes open this truth. 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 1. 2. for the life was manifeſted, and we have ſeen it, and bear witneſſe, and ſhew unto yon that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifeſted unto us. So that we ſee what the life of Saints is; for that life which they here ſpeak of was Chriſt: Secondly, we ſee the place where it centers, before it is made manifeſt; and that is laid open to be in the Father. Thirdly, the way whereby they knew it, and alſo to be theirs was twofold. Firſt by the manifeſtation of it.

Two things are here ſpiritually hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den forth: Firſt a ſpirituall death of Creatures when Chriſt comes to breath upon them the breath of life. Secondly, by his thus comming, ſpeaking, and breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing occaſions life; becauſe his words are ſpirit and life thus ſpoken: So that it is ſaid, The hour is comming, and now is, when the dead ſhall hear the voyce of the Son of God, and they that hear, ſhall live. Now in all this is held forth unto us, The ſpirituall reſurrection of all Saints by Ieſus Chriſt, coming in the ſpirit into them: ſo that though this particular be the leaſt look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after, yet it is of the higheſt concernment; and not
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:153757:73"/> that which moſt men doat of ſo much after death. So that if we look upon our ſpirituall reſurrection, we ſhall ſee that the coming of Chriſt in the Spirit is a manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of Spirituall life, which proves a ſpirituall life; which proves a ſpirituall reſurrection in ſuch Creatures, and in time their Reſt and Center: Now he being the life of Saints: Then firſt, we may obſerve, That Saints life is Ieſus Chriſt. Though before they are making out of their own actings, according to the law of works, do this and live, yet now they ſee that life is deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the cauſe of all actions to God, flowes from this life principled in them: and though they are making a life out of enlargement, or holineſſe in converſation, yet this is a life above it, unbottoming the creature off from it, and centring the Creature in a ſtable and ſolid life: Secondly, the Saints live, becauſe Chriſt lives in them; for though before their liv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>edneſſe, becauſe Chriſt lives in him. So now to ſumme up this Chriſt as he is a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all diſpenſation of God in the Spirit, is a Spiritual life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by vertue of which life in Saints, are Saints ſwallowed up with it, and ſo centred up in it: So that the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or reſt of a Saint is eternall and everlaſting, which is Chriſt the ſpirituall life of God in us; by which life the Creature doth not only live to, but live to do. This life is the motion of his ſpirit; ſo as by this life he doth not onely live, but lives to it; ſo that the creatures ſpirits are wholly ſet apart to live to God: This life is the living in the Spirit, and not in the fleſh, hereby
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:153757:73"/> comes the life of Saints to be a life of love, and a life of God, becauſe they are not at Reſt from all their own labors, and now all things are acted in them, by that Spirit of life, which is Chriſt dwelling in them: now Saints wholly live to God, by the life of God in them, and thus are Saints centred up in God, or Chriſt; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their ſpirits are carried up above the creature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life, which is Chriſt in them, becoming ſpirituall and eternall life to them.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, This ſpirituall Chriſt, as he comes from God, and is manifeſted by God, and ſo known by us, and become Reſt to us, he is ſpirituall redemption and deliverance: Now to looke upon Chriſt in the Spirit he cannot be manifeſted, but he becomes a ſpirituall Jeſus, that is, a Saviour of ſpirits, for he was not a Jeſus as he was in the fleſh, but he was a Jeſus, as he was to come in the Spirit; for the fleſh could not doe it: Yet it was a figure of that ſpiritual ſalvation and liberty, which Chriſt is in the hearts of Saints: For indeed Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is ſalvation it ſelf, and where he in power and glory there is ſalvation; that is, he is a Saviour, or a deliverer of the creature out of that ſpiritual ſlavery, and bondage in which he lives: So as he is become free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and redemption to the heart; and therefore he is ſaid to be made unto us Wiſdom and righteouſneſſe, and ſanctification, and redemption, that is he is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in us, and ſo is become a ſpirituall redemption to us: freeing us ſpiritually from our inward bondage and ſlavery, both that bondage of ſelf and Sathan, whereby we are made to live in ſpiritual freedome: and all this freedome and deliverance is Chriſt in the ſpirit, as he is a ſpirituall diſpenſation deſigned of God for the ſame purpoſe: though many ſouls do work out their own ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by their doing, whoſe ſalvation is falſe: others having ſalvation from ſome falſe chriſt, which workes and acts like this Chriſt; yet the Son hath ſet neither
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:153757:74"/> free; neither doe they know that alone redemption ſalvation and liberty, which is produced by Chriſt, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or appearing in any heart; ſo that the ſpirituall Reſt of ſaints is in and upon that ſalvation, liberty and freedome, which they have in this Chriſt, who is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come this unto them: ſo that all heavy loads and yoaks are removed, all oppoſitions of ſpiri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, are taken off, and all the wearineſſe of ſpirit removed; ſo that now the ſpirits are ſet free, and can no more come into bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage; but Chriſt alone is become ſalvation and liberty to him; ſo that the ſpirit doth ſalace it ſelfe and Reſt in him, who is become freedome and ſalvation to him.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, Chriſt the Reſt of Saints ſpiritually known, is the wiſdome of God in creatures: the wiſdome of God in Saints is, Jeſus Chriſt; and there it is ſaid, <hi>He is made unto us wiſdome,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 30. So that it is the Wiſdome of God, which is Chriſt ſpiritually known, in which Saints Reſt. Fot if they Reſted in the wiſdome of the fleſh, that ſhould be deſtroyed, and ſo no ſafe Reſt and center for them: but the Wiſdome of Chriſt doth unbottome Saints from their own wiſdome, and eſtabliſh himſelfe, even the Wiſdome of the God head in the Creature, to be a Reſt unto the Creature; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as before the Soule and ſpirit were not a Reſt; being from its own wiſdome, plotting and contriving, which way to act and what to doe, not from the Wiſdome of God; but from the wiſdome of the fleſh, onely op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing and gain-ſaying this Wiſdome; which when the Creature could not bring about, what in his owne wiſdome he had contrived<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he muſt needs be perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>inue in all trouble; but now he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed in that; and he is made to Reſt upon the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, Chriſt now taking the Creatures place, and acting in the ſtead of the Creature; ſo that the ſoul is made to walke in and by Wiſdome; it is that Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:153757:74"/> which is pute, peaceable and undefiled. The Wiſdome of the fleſh is corrupted, but this is pure: The Wiſdome of the fleſh hath nothing in it but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſſe, both to the party in whom it is, or in the Kingdome, Church or Family where ir is acted; and for this reaſon, is occaſioned all jarrings and tumults: But the Wiſdome of God, which is Jeſus Chriſt, is peaeeable, it workes abundance of peace and quietneſs in the ſoule, Church or Nation, where it onely is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced; here is a quiet and peaceable habitation, for Saints to Reſt and live upon: wee ſee Chriſt often in Scripture called the Wiſdome of God; and as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24. where the Apoſtle declares Chriſt, in all that are ſaved, to be the Wiſdome and power of God; though this Wiſdome be little eſteemed of by the world, yet it is highly precious in the eſteem of Saints; as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that of the <hi>Proverbs</hi> 3. 15. ver. where that Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is precious, yea, more precious then Rubies; yea, he is expreſſed to be an un-comparable compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; ſo that this Wiſdome of the eternall Spirit, which is Chriſt in us, is deſirable, and therefore above all things: ſaith the Scriptures, <hi>Get Wiſdome,</hi> Prov. 4. 5. yea, there is a happineſſe in the enjoyment of it; for it is the principal thing belongs to a Saint: <hi>Pro.</hi> 4. 7. ſo that Saints are centred up in the Wiſdome of God, and are wholly delivered up into it, to be alone diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by it: ſo that the ſpirit lives in ſweet quietneſſe and Reſt; the Creature being wholly made nothing in his own Wiſdome; and the Wiſdome of God alone or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders all things in him.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, That which ſpiriturlly is called Chriſt in us, is that Peace which is ſpoken by God to us, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from God by us; in which Peace we live and Reſt; ſo that Saints are kept in the Peace of God, which is Chriſt; to this purpoſe is the ſaying in the <hi>Eph. 2. 14. For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:153757:75"/> hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us.</hi> Here the Apoſtle ſets forth Chriſt to be the Peace of the Saints; for whatſoever tends to peace in the Creatures ſpirits, that, I mean which truly tends to the ſame, is Chriſt: for the ſoule before he appeares in it, is like unto the ſhip toſſed with the waves and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt; before Chriſt ſaid unto the waves, Be ſtill: this is that Peace the Apoſtle deſires the Saints may enjoy, which was the <hi>Peace of God which paſſeth all vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi> Phil. 4. 7. which was of ability to keepe their hearts in the knowledge and love of God; now this is that Saints ſpirituall Chriſt, a Peace which is able to keep them in the love of God; and a Peace which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the underſtanding of the Creature; that is, a Peace which the underſtanding of man can never finde out or i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> able to reach under; yea, all the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the world is never able to finde out ſuch a Peace for the Creature as this is: ſo that he is tearmed the prince of Peace, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 6. All the acts of Chriſt in the ſpirits of Beleevers, are Righteouſneſſe and Peace. It is that Peace which the world cannot give; and ſuch a Peace it is, as they cannot take away: When God ſpeaks <hi>Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iſt</hi> into a ſoul, which is Peace, in which none can cauſe trouble in ſuch a ſoul; becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> is become the Peace thereof: indeed men may ſpeak Peace, and Ordinances may ſpeak Peace; and falſe Gods and Chriſts may ſpeake Peace; after which there may be trouble occaſioned: But after God ſpeaks Peace, there can none cauſe trouble; but the ſoule lives and is kept in the Peace of God, and none can make him afraid: therefore the Prophet did utter theſe ſayings: <hi>He ſhall be our Peace, when the Aſſyrians comes into our Land.</hi> This Chriſt is the Peace of Saints in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very condition: ſo that they live in much freedom and joy, becauſe the center and reſt of their ſpirits is peace.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, This Chriſt is Righteouſneſſe and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the Saints, or Sanctification; this not onely by
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:153757:75"/> experience, but by Scripture may be proved: The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tels the Church of Corinth, <hi>That Chriſt of God was made unto them wiſdome and righteouſneſſe and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification and Redemption, 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 30. So that Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and ſanctification <hi>Chriſt</hi> was made unto them ſo that whatſoever is Righteouſneſſe in the Spirits of Saints, is <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpiritually dwelling in them; this is that righteouſneſſe that the Apoſtle deſired to be found in; this is that divine nature which the Saints are made partakers of; to wit, <hi>Chriſt the Righteouſneſſe of God.</hi> This is agreeable to that ſaying concerning Chriſt, <hi>And this is his Name whereby he ſhall be called, THE LORD O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R RIGHTEO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SNESSE: Jer.</hi> 23. 6. &amp; <hi>Jer.</hi> 33. 16. He ſhall not only be called ſo by them, but he really ſhall be made over ſo by God to them; ſo that the Righteouſneſſe of God in us, is Jeſus Chriſt made ſo by God to us, whereby he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes our Righteouſneſſe, a Righteouſneſſe which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes all ours in the fleſh, and makes us-live in the righteouſneſſe of the Spirit: So that now beleevers in this kind, ſhall not be found naked, but cloathed with Chriſt their righteouſneſſe, they ſhall not be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: for they ſhall be made ſtand in the righteouſnes of another. And to be covered with the roabes of the Lamb, made beautifully by Chriſts beauty, and comely by his comelineſſe; ſo that the ſame ſhall dwell in the ſpirits of Saints, that dwels in the Spirit of God; and that ſhall be made a beleevers, to be imployed for God and to God, now beleevers who are made to Reſt in Chriſt, are incompaſſed about with truth, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, in which their ſpirits ſhall live with freedome and unexpreſſible joy for ever.</p>
               <p>And now as this Chriſt dwels in them, as a diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of God: ſo he carries them up in their ſpirits to live and Reſt compleatly in God; ſo as now they live where Chriſt lives, which is in the boſome of God: ſo
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:153757:76"/> that the great deſigne of God in this Chriſt ſpiritually comming is wholly to gather up the ſpirits of creatures into the Spirit, to live dwell or reſt therein; and to this purpoſe he is called, the Power of God: and indeed he is ſo a divine a Power, come forth from God, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh the great deſigne of God in the Spirits of Saints: and therefore Saints finde ſometimes that this Power works in them mightily, and never ceaſes till it gathers up the creature wholly into God, to Reſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly in him: So that to conclude all, when Saints are truly at reſt in God, then in the firſt place, the will of the creature ſhall be centred up in the will of God: and ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he will of God ſhall become the will of the creature: ſo as the will ſhall ceaſe to act any thing, but what is acted by the Will of God: ſo that the Will of of Saints ſhall be gathered up into the will of God: and their Will being centred up in his Will. Here ſhall it be ſaid, The creature hath ceaſed from his own works as God did from his. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 10. and now his Will Reſts in God; though before the Will was bent againſt God, and would not be limited, but all things muſt be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on according to the Will of fleſh; but now it acts ſo no more, but now with Chriſt, not my will, but thy will be performed: ſo as now his will is at Reſt, he wils nothing of himſelfe, it is carried on by the Will of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The mind of the creature is centred in the mind of God, ſo that creatures mindes one thing with God, and the ſame Principall of truth is poſſeſſed in the mind of God: So that now the mind is wholly made ſpirituall, and none but God doth poſſeſſe it: So as now the mind doth ſolace it ſelf &amp; takes ſweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in God: whereas it may be a ſmall time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God did not dwell in the mind, but corruption or ſin at that time; there was not ſuch ſolace in God, but rather in luſt and ſin; neither did the mind delight
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:153757:76"/> in God, or reſt upon him; whereas now being ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſſed with it, is ſweetly made to live above all in God, who is now become the eaſe and reſt of the mind.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The affections of men are centred up in God, and wholly ſwallowed up with him: So as now the creature lives in heaven; That is, with his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the preſence of God with great delight, and ſo he comes really to dwell with God: nothing can come and take up this creatures affections, being they are placed upon God, being made ſpirituall by God: So they act as God acts in them; yea, the affections of the creature and Gods are made both one: ſo as they wheel both from one principle, and by one and the ſame po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. Love moves Gods affection, if it can be ſo ſaid, ſo it moves the creatures affection to God: God is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed with the creature, and the affections are raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with God; he delighteth on the one hand, and the creature on the other: So that Chriſts and Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and joy are both one.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Spirits of Saints are at Reſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are eaſed of all heavy loades and burdens: Chriſt hath given them Reſt, who are eaſed and unloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened of every yoak and burthen: ſo as now his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe is at an end, and no more in his ſpirits, but all taken away, and his ſpirit lives in compleat liberty and freedome.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, He is ſet free, and is at Reſt whom God hath made to ceaſe from his own works, and now God works all in and by his Spirit: That though he hath bin a long time, travelling towards <hi>Canaan,</hi> yet now he is got within the land. That now God flowes in npon his ſpirits with immediate feedings and refreſhments, and ſo now fully ſatisfies the heart with all things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable and deſired: ſo as the Spirit lives in compleat ſatisfaction in all things as he is ſweetly poſſeſſed with him, who is become all things to him, and by this acts
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:153757:77"/> no more in himſelf, nor by himſelf, but now it is that he is dead thereunto: and is ſo quickned in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as that now the worke of Gods Kingdome is made exceeding glorious and is carried on exceeding gloriouſly: So that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ot by arm or ſtrength of the creature, but by the Spirit: The creature being ceaſed from all ſelf-actings, this ſoul truly that Reſt in God. Further he is at Reſt in God, who hath truly paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through the ſtate of inward reſurrection, and now is Aſcended into God: for as Chriſt in his fleſhly form was not at Reſt, becauſe he was not aſcended, ſo no more is the ſpirits of any ſpirituall man at Reſt in God, untill after his ſpirituall reſurrection he be aſcended into God, to dwell compleatly in God: for Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the manifeſtation of the Spirit begets a reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in us, and the powerfull effects of that life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets an aſcenſion of our ſpirits into God: So that now the ſoul having aſcended, can no more deſcend into theſe low things which keepes below, and ſhort of his Glory: but when he appeares in the Spirit within us, and diſcovers his glory to us, it doth ſo overcome the ſpirit, as indeed it is caught up with it, for ever to live in it: for impoſſible it is that the ſpirits can live below God, which occaſioneth trouble and wearineſſe, who hath before truly lived in God, by the vertue of God made manifeſt to live in them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is impoſſible that any ſoul can live and Reſt in God, and ſo aſcend into God, before there be a manifeſtation of the life of God in the creature; for it is God deſcending in his appearance or manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation in us; That both begets a reſurrection, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion of us, ſo that we aſcend by deſcending, and live &amp; Reſt in him by his being manifeſted to live and Reſt in us: ſo that in this particular the creatures life is ſwallowed up, and gathered into the life of God: and as God continues living in them, they ſhall continue
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:153757:77"/> living in him: and as God hath taken up them to be an everlaſting reſt for himſelf, ſo he hath appointed and made himſelf an everlaſting Reſt unto them: So that now they are aſcended in their Spirits into God, and there ſweetly live in God. And laſtly, he lives ſweetly in God, and ſo Reſts in him, who hath God in him, to be an everlaſting light in him: So that his Sun never goes downe, nor Chriſt in him never ceaſes to ſhine forth in light and glory to him: So as according to that ſaying: <hi>There ſhall be no night there, Rev</hi> 21. 25. ſo alſo <hi>Revel.</hi> 22. 5. Though ſome thinke that this is a very high ſtate; yet experience and Scripture do teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy, That it is a ſtate injoyed, or ſhall be injoyed, by all or moſt Saints in theſe our dayes. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60. 19. 20. We ſee the Promiſe God makes with his people is this.</p>
               <p>That the <hi>LORD</hi> ſhall be unto them an everlaſting light, and God their compleat glory, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 60. 19. yea, in the 20th<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> verſe: <hi>Their ſun ſhall no more goe downe, neither their Moon withdraw it ſelf: for the LORD ſhall be their everlaſting light, and the dayes of their mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhall be ended.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here we ſee that in the firſt place, there is a ſtate that ſoules may be clouded in, though they have precious workings of God upon them. Secondly, this ſtate is attended with mourning. Thirdly, there is a degree that is above either; where there ſhall be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther withdrawing of light, or clouding, where all mourning ſhall fly away; but the ſoule ſhall be filled with divine light, and God ſhall never cauſe any more clouds to come upon ſuch a ſoul, but his light ſhall be everlaſting, and the glory of God ſhall fill his ſpirits for ever: ſo that God ſhall become the glory of ſuch a ſpirit, in which glory the ſpirit ſhall reſt for ever: ſo that there is a fulneſſe of glory to be enjoyed in the ſpirits of the Saints. when God doth dwell in them, and become a diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:153757:78"/> in reference to the ſhallow capacity of the creature, and that fulneſſe of glory to ſatisfy the ſame in every appearance of glory within the creature: ſo that now when ſaints come to enjoy this diſpenſation from God it being an everlaſting diſpenſation of God in them, which cannot wax old or decay: ſo are they made to live unchangeable in the ſame: And this is the ſtayed Reſt of ſaints: For one thing there is in this: That no ſoule can truly reſt in any diſpenſation unleſſe it be a diſpenſation which abides for ever, and cannot be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo as his Reſt cannot be diſſolved likewiſe, ſo that to Reſt thus is ſtayedly ſure, and everlaſting, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periſhable, and undiſſolveable: and alſo he reſts in God who lives in everlaſting joy and peace, ſo as nothing can diſturb his peace, nor diſſolve his joy, ſo as to cauſe either to ceaſe. For come what condition will upon the body, yet his ſpirit is ſwallowed up with joy: he doth not power upon creatures as formerly he did: but now he lives by rejoycing, and rejoyces by living; No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without him is a trouble to him, ſuch a trouble as touches his ſpirituall joy: He receives alwayes, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, alwayes and depends alwayes, ſo that his ſpirits are kept in everlaſting joy and peace, and all ſorrow and mourning is flown away: no more ſorrow of ſpirit is known by him, neither doth he experience any more ſpirituall pain within him, but in ſtead thereof is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht peace and joy for evermore.</p>
